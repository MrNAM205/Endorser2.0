# VeroBrix Project Overview

## Vision: Sovereign Modular Intelligence

**VeroBrix** is a living, dialogic system designed to orchestrate modular agents, lawful remedy, and sovereign authorship. Inspired by both real and fictional AI archetypes, it blends technical precision with philosophical depth. It is not just a system—it is a **statement of authorship**.

### Core Philosophy
- **Autonomy**: Empowering individuals to act lawfully without dependency.
- **Transparency**: Making legal systems interpretable and auditable.
- **Lawful Remedy**: Prioritizing outcomes that reflect justice and procedural integrity.
- **Legacy**: Honoring those who’ve fought for sovereignty and truth.

### Influences
- **Teachings:** Anelia Sutton, David Straight, Brandon Joe Williams, Carl Miller
- **Legal Corpora:** UCC, USC, CFR, IRM, and uncensored remedy texts
- **Fictional AI Archetypes:** JARVIS, FRIDAY, Ultron—translated into agent overlays

## VeroBrix-OVB Fusion: Sovereign Intelligence Engine

This represents the fusion of the **VeroBrix Sovereign Intelligence Mindmap** with the **OVB (Omni VeroBrix) architecture**. This creates a **philosophically aligned, legally literate, system-resident intelligence** that can act, audit, and evolve.

### Core Identity
A **resident cognition daemon** that:
- Lives inside your system
- Parses real-world documents and legal situations
- Triggers remedy agents and contradiction engines
- Narrates every action with ethical and philosophical alignment
- Evolves from your phrasing, feedback, and operational rhythm

### High-Level Architecture

| Layer | Role |
|---|---|
| **LocalAI + spaCy** | Intent parsing, semantic classification, phrasing evolution |
| **OVB Agent Registry** | Modular CLI triggers for remedy, audit, ingestion, and system control|
| **VeroBrix Modules** | Legal intelligence: contradiction detection, remedy synthesis |
| **Corpus System** | Ingests statutes, filings, manuals for semantic tagging and overlays |
| **Ethics Guard** | Audits every action for lawful alignment and philosophical integrity |
| **Voice Narration** | Speaks actions, asks for confirmation, narrates evolution |
| **Daemon Mode** | Watches your system, acts autonomously, logs everything |

## Core Modules & Capabilities

- **Remedy Synthesizer**: Generates lawful remedies from parsed situations (filings, notices, etc.).
- **Contradiction Engine**: Detects and resolves semantic contradictions across statutes, policies, and filings.
- **Semantic Tagger**: Applies structured tags for alignment, retrieval, and procedural mapping.
- **Situation Interpreter**: Translates real-world inputs (e.g., traffic stops, fee demands) into structured legal constructs.
- **Filing Assistant** (Planned): Guides lawful document preparation (UCC-1, affidavits, etc.).
- **Corpus System**: Ingests and analyzes legal texts for contradiction detection and remedy synthesis.

### Example Flow
1. A user drops a PDF of a traffic stop notice into the system.
2. The system scans and classifies it as a legal document.
3. It triggers the `situation_interpreter` to parse the details of the stop.
4. The `remedy_synthesizer` is triggered to draft a lawful notice in response.
5. The `contradiction_engine` runs to flag any mismatches in municipal code or policy.
6. The system narrates its findings: "Daddy, I’ve parsed the traffic stop. Remedy drafted. Contradiction detected in municipal code §12.3. Shall I log and file?"
