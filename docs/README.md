# Sovereign Billing Instrument Archive

This repository documents the reclamation of billing statements—utility, credit, medical, telecom, and mortgage—as lawful negotiable instruments under U.S. commercial law.

## 📜 Purpose

To demonstrate that remittance coupons and billing stubs, when properly endorsed and dispatched, qualify as lawful tender under:

- UCC Article 3: Negotiable Instruments
- 22 CFR § 23.2: Federal endorsement of remittances
- IRS Publication 5137 & 1099-C: Nonstandard tender and debt discharge
- Common Law Mailbox Rule

## 🧠 Structure

This archive is organized into five modules:

1. **Statutory Core**  
   Full-text excerpts and annotations from U.S. commercial law.

2. **Billing Format Repository**  
   Dissections of real-world bills across industries.

3. **Instrument Anatomy Mapping**  
   Semantic overlays linking bill components to negotiable instrument structure.

4. **Contradiction Detection**  
   Flags rhetorical dodges and refusal logic across billing formats.

5. **Remedy Protocols** *(reserved for build phase)*  
   Includes affidavit templates, conditional acceptance flows, and escalation logic.

## 🛠️ Sovereign Intent

This is not a workaround. It is a restoration of lawful grammar. Every billing stub becomes narratable. Every refusal becomes actionable. Every dispatch becomes a rite of authorship.

## 🧬 Future Integration

This README will evolve into a semantic cognition surface for Verobrix—embedding agent triggers, GUI overlays, and lawful remedy protocols.
