**SUBJECT:** Private Administrative Process - Tender of Payment for Instrument README.md

Dear Sir/Madam,

This correspondence serves as a formal tender of payment, presented in good faith, for the instrument identified as "README.md". This instrument, having been properly endorsed and accepted for value, is hereby presented as a valid and lawful tender for the discharge and settlement of any alleged obligation or account associated therewith.

Be advised that this tender is made in accordance with the principles of commercial law and equity. Under Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) 3-603, a tender of payment of an obligation to pay an instrument made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument, if refused, discharges the obligation of the obligor to pay interest on the obligation after the due date and discharges any party with a right of recourse against the obligor to the extent of the amount of the tender.

Your refusal to accept this lawful tender of payment will be considered a dishonor of a commercial instrument and a refusal of a valid tender. All rights, remedies, and recourse, both at law and in equity, are expressly reserved without prejudice, pursuant to UCC 1-308.

This is a private administrative process. Your acceptance of this tender, or your failure to return the instrument with specific objections within [e.g., 3, 7, 10] days, will be deemed as acceptance of this tender and agreement to the discharge of the obligation.

Sincerely,

By: John A. Smith
Authorized Representative / Agent
