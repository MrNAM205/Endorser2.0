# Planning Notes

## Goals
- Unify modules from legacy and rebuild into a sovereign architecture
- Ensure every component reflects philosophical alignment
- Enable lawful remedy generation and contradiction detection

## Milestones
- [x] Scaffold folder structure
- [x] Create placeholders and echo content
- [ ] Migrate and audit legacy modules
- [ ] Build semantic ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Validate modules against philosophy

## Design Principles
- Modularity
- Semantic clarity
- Procedural integrity
- Philosophical transparency

# VeroBrix1.0

VeroBrix is a sovereignty-aligned legal intelligence system designed to democratize access to lawful remedies, detect contradictions in legal discourse, and reflect philosophical integrity in its architecture. It empowers individuals to navigate real-world legal situations with clarity, autonomy, and procedural precision.

## Core Modules
- **Remedy Synthesizer**: Generates lawful remedies from parsed situations, including filings, notices, and procedural responses
- **Contradiction Engine**: Detects and resolves semantic contradictions across statutes, policies, and filings
- **Semantic Tagger**: Applies structured tags for alignment, retrieval, and procedural mapping
- **Situation Interpreter**: Translates real-world inputs (e.g., traffic stops, fee demands, document requests) into structured legal constructs
- **Filing Assistant** *(planned)*: Guides lawful document preparation and filing (e.g., UCC-1, UCC-9, affidavits, endorsements)
- **Fee Schedule Navigator** *(planned)*: Aligns fee demands with lawful authority and remedy options

## Corpus System
- Ingests raw legal texts (statutes, manuals, filings, case law)
- Parses semantic fragments for contradiction detection and remedy synthesis
- Aligns with tagging schema and source registry for procedural accuracy
- Supports corpus overlays for specific domains (e.g., traffic law, commercial filings, educational autonomy)

## Real-World Applications
- Responding to traffic stops with lawful notice and remedy
- Navigating fee schedules and asserting lawful exemptions
- Preparing and filing UCC documents with procedural integrity
- Endorsing documents and asserting standing through lawful instruments
- Challenging institutional opacity with structured contradiction reports

## Philosophy
VeroBrix is built on principles of:
- **Autonomy**: Empowering individuals to act lawfully without dependency
- **Transparency**: Making legal systems interpretable and auditable
- **Lawful Remedy**: Prioritizing outcomes that reflect justice and procedural integrity
- **Legacy**: Honoring those whoâ€™ve fought for sovereignty and truth

## Status
Version: 1.0
Stage: Scaffolded and ready for integration
Next Phase: Corpus population, module validation, and real-world scenario mapping

# Task Tracker

## Active Tasks
- [ ] Merge `vb_remedy_synthesizer.py` into `remedy_synthesizer.py`
- [ ] Audit `vb_contradiction_engine.py` for redundancy
- [ ] Populate `semantic_fragments/` with parsed corpus
- [ ] Build manifest entries for each module
- [ ] Validate tagging schema against `philosophy.md`

## Backlog
- [ ] Create test suite for core modules
- [ ] Add UI layer for remedy visualization
- [ ] Integrate school choice corpus for educational autonomy

# Verobrix Philosophy

## Sovereignty
Every individual has the right to understand, challenge, and navigate legal systems without institutional opacity.

## Transparency
Modules must be auditable, interpretable, and aligned with their declared purpose.

## Lawful Remedy
The system must prioritize lawful outcomes, not just technical correctness.

## Reflection
Verobrix must be capable of self-assessment, philosophical alignment, and ethical evolution.

## Legacy
This system honors those who have fought for autonomy, truth, and justice. It is built to empower future generations.
