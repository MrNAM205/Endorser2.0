# NOTICE OF DISPUTE: Unlawful Denial of Negotiable Instrument

**Date:** 2025-09-20
**To:** None
**From:** None
**Account:** [Account Number]

This notice is in response to your claim, stated on the remittance document, that it is "not a negotiable instrument".

This claim is in direct contradiction to the definition of a negotiable instrument as laid out in UCC ยง 3-104. The remittance coupon, when endorsed and tendered for payment, meets all the requirements of a negotiable instrument.

Your unilateral declaration does not supersede the Uniform Commercial Code.

Please be advised that your refusal to accept this lawful tender constitutes a dishonor of the instrument under UCC ยง 3-502.

I demand that you process the tender as presented. Failure to do so will be considered a formal dishonor and will be escalated accordingly.
