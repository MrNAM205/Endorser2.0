Transcript:
(00:32) Hello everyone and welcome to Medicum Authentica. I'm your host Dr. Andrew
(00:37) Calfman and tonight I'm not going to focus on natural health or germ theory
(00:43) or viology but instead I'm going to have a discussion about law uh with someone a
(00:48) very unique uh gentleman who I encountered his work only a month or two
(00:54) ago but I've gone through uh his uh course an advanced course and um we were
(01:00) able to connect and and uh we hit it off very well and we're both kind of pursuing
(01:07) uh similar things um in parallel and I'm speaking of the one and only Brandon Joe
(01:13) Williams who has come on the scene about a little over a year ago and developed
(01:19) quite a big following putting out free course material and really going uh on a deep dive into the law and not just one
(01:26) section but actually covering uh many different areas of law. So you can see
(01:32) his material and get kind of a comprehensive uh overlook of the areas that people are really uh researching.
(01:40) And uh Brandon also even before he studied law had some very interesting accomplishments. He's the author of a
(01:46) couple of uh books on marketing and relationships. Um and he also has extensively uh um been a member of the
(01:54) Church of Scientology. uh done a lot of uh studying and really educated me on uh
(01:59) some of the true um nature of what's going on in that church. And of course, it's uh not what everybody thinks on the
(02:06) surface. So, I'm very pleased to welcome uh Brandon Joe Williams. Hello. Hello.
(02:13) Thank you. My pleasure. And for your for your for your show, just to be just to
(02:20) be clear, uh you know, it's it sounds to me possibly like your show has a lot of medical professionals or or professional
(02:26) type people. So my my platform is definitely uh very very wild and silly.
(02:32) Uh I do have a couple of URLs that we can use instead of the main URL. I have uh don'tbe slave.com and I have
(02:38) brandonjo.com. But uh there definitely should be a bit of a disclaimer. I will definitely
(02:45) uh not be acting that way on this show, but uh just a little disclaimer, my platform is pretty,
(02:51) shall we say, uh oh gosh, how would we even describe my platform? Um I don't
(02:57) know, you know, you you use sort of uh a lot of adolescent male humor. Yes. Yes.
(03:03) Yes. Attract um you know, the right audience. I I I'm trying very hard to
(03:09) take just just as a background because I want to clear this up. I don't want people to be, oh, what the what the heck is this guy? Um,
(03:16) I I I I'm trying to take the subject of law, which which I am a marketing
(03:21) demographic person. That's what my entire history is. Marketing demographics, lot of uh demographic
(03:28) research, surveys, literally going on the street with pens and clipboards uh for thousands and thousands of hours.
(03:35) This is my background. Um, and I wanted to take the subject of deep dive law,
(03:41) which as I progressed through my own studies, I realized the average age of the individual interested in that was
(03:49) either a 70-year-old uh, white person or a a 25year-old black
(03:56) man. Uh, literally that was like pretty much the entire demographic interested. And it was either the the 70-year-old
(04:03) white person was was trying to change the way they see America going in the
(04:08) wrong direction and the younger black man was because he was in trouble with something with litigation and he was trying to figure it out uh very very
(04:15) earnestly. And I decided to myself that I wanted to expand that uh that
(04:21) demographic and I wanted to be uh try to push this information into a much lower
(04:27) demographic. I've gotten that demographic down to probably around
(04:32) early 30s. I've been able to to stretch out that demographic all the way down to
(04:39) I'd say about 32 is probably I mean we we definitely get some teenagers and some 20-year-olds,
(04:45) but it's it's really not. But I've like solidly like seriously stretched the
(04:51) demographic all the way down to about 32 years old. So for me, my platform, the
(04:57) entire purpose of that was to stretch out that demographic of which I have done successfully, but it is extremely
(05:02) wild. It's like a Jerry Springer show. Well, you know, I mean, to be honest, right, people generally don't want to
(05:09) sit down and read law books. It's pretty it's pretty dry material, right? So yeah
(05:15) now of course there is the attraction of you know being able to really um have
(05:20) all the freedom that you deserve as a natural man and there is the attraction
(05:26) also of you know the financial aspects right you call it infinite money and but
(05:32) there has to you know like still even if we said oh you could get a million dollars if you read this you know law
(05:39) dictionary cover to cover I don't think too many people would do it So I think
(05:44) it's great using that technique and um you know because a lot of folks just
(05:50) need a a lightness about it to enter that and you know like for example when
(05:56) I saw you and Joe Lustika have that chemistry and the extreme sarcasm right it's like it just gives a casual context
(06:03) that you can talk about this and actually you know have fun like you know tonight we're going to talk about a lawsuit that I'm in and uh you know I'm
(06:11) not freaking out every day about having to you know go into court and present my case or anything like that. It happens
(06:17) very slowly. You have a lot of time you know to prepare and and do everything
(06:22) and uh you know um it's kind of a fun opportunity actually. Oh yeah yeah
(06:30) yeah. I mean to your point I am I am trying very hard to
(06:37) invite I'm trying basically my my my my whole goal what I'm trying to do is I'm trying
(06:43) to to kind of nail that center demographic which is where it's people
(06:48) who who aren't completely like I guess you could say like Tik Tok. It's a
(06:54) little bit it's too much for me. I can't I just can't do it. Uh I don't want to do it. Uh but I want to get like halfway
(07:02) to that point where it's like the people who who don't really want to read but
(07:08) what happens is they they they come across such uh um uh cat catalytic
(07:15) uh uh video or audio format content that it that it blasts them into a
(07:23) motivational level where they are or they are tearing through books. I feel
(07:28) like it's it's I am the I am the the the gasoline's already there, especially with the with the environment, the way
(07:33) things are in the country right now. The gasoline's already there. I just want to be that spark. And I feel like I feel
(07:40) like I've done a really good job of being a Jerry Springer show in a way where I can I I I create that spark and
(07:48) then the per that it creates that person to want to, okay, okay, I'm willing to read now. Do you see? And I and I'm very
(07:54) good at that. I will say I think I I think I've done a really good job of that specifically. Well, that I mean
(08:00) that's the most important thing because we're really, you know, we're getting at inspiration and you know that's really the only thing we can do from platforms
(08:07) like this, right? Is inspire people to uh take their own action by setting an example by, you know, using whatever uh
(08:14) devices are at our disposal. So, you know, I commend you for having such a a large reach in such a short time. Um it
(08:21) really shows that uh you know there is a strong desire out there and hopefully we'll provide some further uh enriching
(08:28) content uh the rest of this discussion. Love it. So should I kind of uh set
(08:34) things up or do you want to talk about any more general things? Uh it's up to you. Uh you you are a lot more aware of
(08:41) your demographic than I am. Uh whatever you think would be best. Well, you know, I'm not really sure who is going to be
(08:48) interested in this. I think it's going to reach uh perhaps you know definitely in my audience people are interested and
(08:54) I do talk about this on my platforms on my private platforms but this is a little bit broader and you know I've
(09:00) really been uh Brandon looking at all of the people out in the space I mean I'm sure I haven't identified everyone but
(09:07) there are quite a number of folks talking about all kinds of issues related to for example uh consumer
(09:13) credit uh different types of loan related transactions and credit cards a lot of things about passports, driver's
(09:20) license, uh you know, status of as a US citizen and all this material. And many
(09:26) of the processes that people teach, right, they always say that, you know,
(09:32) you may not be successful, so you have to be ready to sue or to be sued at some
(09:38) point. But there's not a lot of folks that seem to have experience um actually
(09:44) going through the litigation or teaching about specific uh strategies and I know
(09:50) this is uh an area that you're getting into in your focus as well. So um that's
(09:55) why I thought this would be a a good discussion to have because uh what occurred is that I was um following some
(10:03) process using negotiable instruments that were sent to me you know by a credit card uh bank and sending them in
(10:11) in a way that I think is an appropriate way to pay. And I think the starting point we have to realize is that in our
(10:18) entire banking and a financial system since 1933 there's no real money in terms of
(10:25) something of tangible value like gold and silver coin which you know in the constitution section 1 article 10 right
(10:32) is the uh money or the official legal tender of the United States government
(10:37) but um through the emergency uh legislation in 1933 that was taken out
(10:43) of the system. And since that time, all we have is paper. There's no real thing
(10:49) of value. And once you understand exactly what that paper is based on and how it's created, you realize that you
(10:56) can't pay in any way a meaningful way with anything of value, all you can do is uh move this paper uh around the
(11:03) system according to the rules. And so we are trying as a community, right, to
(11:09) learn the rules of how this works and what our place is. And we don't all have exact right answers yet. And partly
(11:17) taking action in the courts is going to help us learn those answers because the judgment that will occur will tell us
(11:24) what you know if we're right or if we're not right. Yes. So there is some risk involved. And so by taking action like
(11:33) this and trying to, you know, use this paper in the the appropriate way, um, I
(11:39) ended up getting sued by the bank. And I'm not going to give the names of the
(11:44) parties right now because I'm pro if I don't have to sign a non-disclosure agreement in the future, I'm going to uh
(11:51) release everything publicly because it'll be on the public record. Um, and
(11:56) so I was served, you know, with papers and had to figure out how to respond.
(12:03) And it it's still early on, but we're but I did write a response with all my
(12:08) defense strategies, counter claims, uh, included. Uh, so we can talk a little
(12:14) bit about that and I'll tell you what. Yeah. Say a couple things here cuz Yeah, please do. A lot of things here. I'd
(12:19) like to just cover a couple things here. Uh so first and foremost just to be clear uh you know for a long long time I
(12:26) was trying to get compliance and and I was trying to get enforcement in other
(12:32) ways besides litigation because I I I am like everyone else. I am not some
(12:37) superhero. Uh that people think I am. Uh I I'm the pickle man. You know
(12:42) what I mean? That's my uh people think I'm a superhero, but I'm really not. Uh, I try to be as transparent as I can
(12:48) because I want people to realize that I have the human experience no different than they do. I went through tremendous,
(12:54) tremendous fear and terror and sleepless nights and difficulties with friends and being removed from all sorts of things
(13:01) that I care about very much. Uh, so it's one of those things where
(13:06) um I, you know, it's been a long road. I I've been able
(13:12) to get us up to maybe 15 to 20% of the time we're able to get some sort of
(13:20) headway with these various activities. Uh but there's absolutely no pattern to it whatsoever. It's just like um just
(13:29) shooting completely in the dark. Uh you you one person may get wonderful
(13:34) results. You do the exact same thing. You send it to the exact same place with all the exact same paperwork done with
(13:40) the exact same pen. You could send the freaking pen in the mail and and and this exact same thing. The stickers for
(13:46) the the parcel. It could be the same cardboard for the freaking everything could be exactly the same. You could do
(13:52) you could do molecule searches and you know what I mean? You could go and it just it's just you just never know what
(13:58) you're going to get. It's it's just a dice. You're rolling the dice, right? So, so after a long time of avoiding
(14:05) litigation and and not wanting to get into it and finding it to be a very um
(14:12) um um what would you call it? Intimidating thing. Uh I I I was just I just really
(14:19) for a long long time and then finally I started to realize that it's kind of like the only path left. I I went from
(14:27) writing crazy weird things to drawing pictures to sending in Polaroids of me
(14:33) in in in silly outfits. I have a bunch of silly outfits and onesies. I mean, I
(14:38) was doing it all. I was doing phone calls. I was doing faxes. I was doing
(14:43) you know and and I just realized that um you know I realized a lot of things
(14:50) during that time period including the way in which I'm going to go about the litigation is very different than
(14:56) anybody's ever seen before. Um, so there are a lot of good things that have come out of that, but it was just a
(15:01) realization that uh the way that the system looks at it is you're just kind
(15:06) of like a little barking dog, a little barking chihuahua until you litigate and
(15:12) then once you litigate, you're taken seriously as an adult. It's basically like you're a child until you prove that
(15:18) you're an adult. And you prove that you're an adult when when you can properly present yourself in a court of
(15:24) law. That's just really and people can complain and and moan and freak out about that. And uh I just I was
(15:32) never complaining about that. I just didn't want to do it. Uh until I realized that
(15:37) there's really not any other option. uh and and if I really want to nail this
(15:42) thing down, I'm going to have to become extremely proficient in this. So, I started studying day and night. And I
(15:48) have been studying quite a lot for quite some time before I decided to kind of dip my feet in. We just filed our first
(15:55) suit uh just a few days ago. It's not even it's not they just received it at the uh at the court. So, there's a bunch
(16:02) that I'm going to be doing on my own and then I'm doing some for some of my clients. I feel very confident in what I
(16:10) can do in the court system. I do not feel confident in the procedural aspect
(16:15) of the way that the court moves. I'm starting to feel more confident because
(16:21) I study and I study and I study and I and I'm very adamant about clearing up all of the definitions of all the words,
(16:27) which is very very important to me. And so I am learning pretty rapidly and and
(16:32) I will be learning more rapidly as we move through the court system. And I'm realizing that
(16:38) every lawyer that I come in contact with, uh, I I am literally stepping into
(16:43) the courtroom for the first time, but I'm already uh uh 400 stories above every other
(16:50) lawyer I come into contract with. And I that's something that I mentioned to you uh on the phone is that
(16:57) myself and you think in the same way. We think that we need to be uh 10 star
(17:02) warriors before we enter the battle, right? and we're willing to put in the work even if that requires many many
(17:09) thousands of hours to do so. What's happening is when we're arriving on the battlefield and realizing that everybody
(17:14) else in the battlefield is a one star, we would have been fine as a three star, but we're a 10 star. And uh I think that
(17:21) is the one of the most important things for people to realize because it's a lot
(17:26) less intimidating than you think. The the intimidation is an illusion. It is entirely an illusion. It is a It is a
(17:33) bunch of children with cardboard shields and and and they just kind of they're
(17:39) just kind of in diapers and they they they they're just they poop their pants and they're just running around and
(17:44) that's been my experience so far including a lot of the prosay people that I have had the pleasure to speak to. So it is a very interesting
(17:52) field because I I I very much very very strongly want to create some sort of
(17:58) roydant course and give it away for free. Uh describing all of this, describing the mindset, describing the
(18:05) procedure, describing, you know, kind of everything the same way I did the contract killer course. Uh that's in the
(18:12) near future of what I want to do. So just to give a background on that, I am just now very very seriously entering
(18:19) into the litigation atmosphere. Yeah. Well, we we both are, you know,
(18:26) very uh similar in our thoughts about this and I was not rushing into it either. In fact, you know, I I I feel
(18:34) myself fortunate now, but you know, the other party took action and sued me. So that that kind of I didn't have a
(18:40) choice. Yeah. Right. It's time to go. And you know, I I definitely agree that
(18:46) the the profession of attorneys, right, which is is different from what we're
(18:52) talking about here because they learn law from really a procedural aspect.
(18:57) Yeah. Right. Civil procedure, uh whereas they don't necessarily study the body of
(19:03) law to the same degree that we do. So, they're going to be largely ignorant of what we're talking about. Now even some
(19:10) of the judges and I I already experienced this in the past when um I was an expert witness in mental health
(19:16) and we had cases before the court all the time and the judges didn't know the
(19:22) precedent cases um in that area even though they were
(19:27) regularly assigned these cases. They didn't like even take the time to learn it and uh sometimes we had to educate uh
(19:35) the judge um about these matters. Right. So, you may possibly be in that uh
(19:41) position. The the one thing I would say though is that you have to be able to to
(19:47) understand what you're doing and back it up. So, for example, if you walk into a
(19:52) courthouse or a county clerk's office to file documents, right, and um like I had
(19:57) this uh this happened to me. Now, I will tell you that I'm actually um
(20:04) wrote my paperwork and filed it as agent for my all caps name as the defendant.
(20:11) Right. So, good. I'm not that person. Um because that's an abstract, you know,
(20:16) corporate entity or trust and in order to file the affidavit of service. So,
(20:23) you know, you have to guarantee that when you file documents in a court case, they actually get to all the parties and
(20:30) they there are special paperwork to certify that you actually sent it to them and that they actually received it.
(20:36) And so this affidavit of service is that document and the defendant, you know,
(20:41) quote unquote, is not allowed to certify that affidavit, right? Because it's a
(20:47) conflict of interest. However, when I went to um affirm that document, um they
(20:54) said, "Oh, you can't. You're the defendant." And I said, "No, I'm not the defendant. I'm the agent for the defendant as principal." And I said, "I
(21:02) have a power of attorney document to back that up if you'd like to see it." And that's all I needed to say. And then
(21:08) he's like, "Oh, no problem, sir." And then he notorized it and then he filed it. Right. So all I had to do was just
(21:16) understand what I was doing and what the basis and have another, you know, either I could refer to a a statute or I could
(21:23) refer to a document that was the evidence needed to back up that claim.
(21:29) And if you are prepared to that level, um that's what you need to be. You don't
(21:35) have to know every law, right? You can always ask for a recess to prepare your response to something. Uh everything
(21:42) moves very very slowly. Um, right. In my case, there's been uh three documents submitted, two from the
(21:49) plaintiff and one from me, and there's not even a judge assigned yet. So, and
(21:55) it the original uh filing was in September, and now we're in January,
(22:00) right? So, you you have plenty of time to um deal with these things. Nothing is, you know, um uh immediate and and uh
(22:09) nerve-wrenching. Um, and I think the chance of actually having to go into
(22:15) court and testify is pretty low. Although I would with these subjects Oh, yeah. I've I've known a lot of people.
(22:21) I've talked to a lot of people and I've never heard of anything even close to a courtroom. I mean, even even close to a
(22:27) courtroom, right? Well, I think uh the only way you're really going to go there is if you file in small claims court.
(22:33) And um that actually may be uh a worthwhile um tactic for some cases
(22:39) where the amount is you know low enough to do that uh because there you can just
(22:45) basically tell the the judge what's going on and if you explain it properly
(22:50) uh you may very well be successful. Yeah.
(22:56) Yeah. It's exciting. So in this case uh we have the credit
(23:02) card bank um filing suit and interestingly on the top of their um
(23:08) summons it says consumer credit transaction right and so for example if
(23:14) you go to file in federal court there'll be a form uh to submit your complaint
(23:19) and on there it'll ask you which section of the law is relevant to your suit and
(23:24) one of those choices is consumer credit. So it right this is definitely an area
(23:30) where there's commonly litigation occurring. Um and then here's an
(23:35) interesting thing that if you get sued by a you know so-called creditor that
(23:41) they the law tries to favor them and and um by if you're scared and you don't do
(23:47) anything about it, they get what's called a default judgment. So they give you they write this on all the papers of
(23:53) course but they say you know you have 30 days or 60 days or 20 days whatever it
(23:58) is to respond and if not right basically the judge
(24:04) will say you know guilty. So just respond even if your response is
(24:10) you know I need more time that they'll they'll give you more time. Uh but don't you know shoot yourself in the foot by
(24:17) uh just giving away the money. So now the cause of action here that they sued for is kind of
(24:25) interesting. So they mentioned a couple of things. So one is Do you want to do you want to talk about what that means cause of action at all? Yeah. Yes. Yes.
(24:31) So the cause of action is the actual basis for the lawsuit, right? So if you
(24:37) are going to initiate a lawsuit, right, you have to have a cause of action. Like it could be for example breach of
(24:44) contract. Um because all if you're talking about litigation in finance,
(24:50) right, there's always a relationship. There's a bank or you know creditor and a borrower or a loaner and a borrower.
(24:57) Um so in that case um the you know the
(25:02) cause of action could be related to a breach of contract because there's always a contract between the borrower and the lender. But there are other
(25:08) causes of action. Um but but you you know this is also that in the law itself
(25:15) if you search these different causes of action and this may vary by state or federal jurisdiction that there might be
(25:21) specific criteria to meet uh the burden of proof for that cause of action. Now
(25:28) with breach of contract that's kind of wide and you know contract law is pervasive and it's a massive uh subject
(25:34) and it's definitely something you know I would say that there you need to understand contract law and trust law to
(25:41) at least a basic level of proficiency to really be able to handle these matters um in terms of litigation. Yeah. But but
(25:49) it's not those are not very complicated. Uh they're just probably and contracts you know are something that we we enter
(25:56) into all the time. They may not be on paper and actually the law says that they don't have to be expressed on
(26:02) paper. Yeah. Um right. So anytime you know Brandon um gosh will like I would
(26:07) love to talk to you. Will you do my show and then I'll give you a copy of it to put on your channel. Right. We just we
(26:13) just made a contract right there as long as he agrees. Yeah. And like if you're let's say even
(26:18) if you're driving a car, you have a duty the way the way the law looks at it, you have a duty to make sure you're not
(26:23) running people over with your car, right? Even that even that is sort of like a it's not quite looked at as a
(26:30) contract, but it almost kind of is because it's sort of like by driving that car there there is sort of like this unspoken contract that you have a
(26:37) duty not to run people over on the crosswalk, right? So the cause of action for being run over by the crosswalk is
(26:43) that there was a duty uh you know that duty was breached. I mean it wouldn't it
(26:48) wouldn't come up as a breach of contract necessarily on the actual paper, but but everything like you're saying it's true.
(26:54) everything that you're doing is some sort of contract. Um, every time you communicate with someone, every time you
(27:00) purchase something, every time you uh speak to someone, I mean, even speaking
(27:05) to someone and and increasing or decreasing their emotional tone in a way could be considered some sort of
(27:12) emotional exchange, contractual emotional exchange. That's that's getting a bit esoteric, but I'm just
(27:17) trying to uh point out that that really everything literally everything I mean breathing is a contract if you really
(27:24) want to get down to it. Anything that exchanges anything between anything pretty much, you know.
(27:30) Yeah. So breathing is what? A contract between you and the air. Well, you you could say it as a contract that, you
(27:37) know, you're you're converting uh oxygen into carbon dioxide and and
(27:42) you're exchanging that carbon dioxide with trees, you know. Uh yeah. So, that's good. It's a contract with the
(27:48) plants because you give them CO2, they give you back oxygen, right? Exactly. Yeah. That's a really good uh good one.
(27:54) And it also helped people understand the hoax of climate change. Yes. Oh god.
(27:59) Yes. That's a big one. Yeah. So they listed um uh two causes of
(28:09) action um on this uh well actually yes first and second. Now the first one is
(28:14) kind of interesting because it it's essentially breach of contract. They say that you know I violated the card member
(28:22) agreement by failing to make periodic payments as required. Right. Now here
(28:27) it's the definition of payment uh that perhaps is a key issue to understand how
(28:33) they could make that claim. Yes. Um but in order to establish themselves um as
(28:41) upholding their end of the bargain of that agreement uh they first say that they basically I applied and received a
(28:48) credit account which they own which is true. They own the account. Um and that
(28:53) they are the original creditor. Now this is where um I believe fraud comes in
(28:59) because the original creditor means that they are the source of the assets uh
(29:04) that are lent or provided as as credit. Yes.
(29:10) Okay. So that's the first cause of action, right? So as original creditor u
(29:16) they fulfilled their contractual duties and obligations but as a card member I
(29:22) did not uh because I failed to make payments. Now the second cause of action
(29:27) is kind of interesting and it's really defensive on their part where they
(29:33) basically say that they sent me periodic statements and that I did not object to
(29:39) them. Okay. Um, and what that really means is
(29:44) that the there was no dispute on the account because um, according to federal
(29:51) law, if the account is under dispute, they are not allowed to pursue
(29:58) collection services. And this lawsuit would be considered a collection services, right? In fact, on the top of
(30:05) their complaint, they say this is I believe they say this is an attempt to collect a debt.
(30:12) So, they wouldn't be allowed to do that if it was in dispute. So, they're pretty much saying this defensively. Oh, you
(30:18) didn't dispute these bills. Therefore, we have a right to sue you. But that's not the case either, actually. Yeah. I
(30:26) just didn't dispute it in uh perhaps the way that they recommended on the back of their billing statements. Yeah. Well,
(30:35) they don't, you know, we we we have a lot we have hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of people doing all this stuff
(30:40) right now. They don't get it. We We had one just
(30:45) today. I mean, every single day I see something new, right, from Bridgeest. Uh I think it's a mortgage. I could be
(30:51) wrong. I think it's a mortgage. And they say right on the response that they do
(30:57) not accept promisary notes. And I just fell out of my chair. I was laughing so
(31:02) hard. that would void the mortgage uh because the mortgage mentions a
(31:08) negotiable instrument right in it. Well, Federal Reserve notes are promisary notes. So, they they literally just told
(31:14) you they will not be accepting Federal Reserve notes. So, now you get to a point now where you say, "Well, how you
(31:20) want gold and silver coins? What do you want?" You know what I mean? I can't pay you anymore. You're you're saying, "I cannot physically pay you." Which is so
(31:28) funny because UCCC3 is very clear that you you cannot refuse
(31:33) uh any negotiable instrument payment which would be you know any type of promisary note any sort of uh a promise
(31:40) to pay any sort of written signed promise to pay any sort of bill of exchange which would be an order to pay
(31:47) you they cannot actually um deny these things and actually there's a section of
(31:52) UCCC 3 that states that once you even offer these things to them they even if
(31:59) they do reject it or do not accept it. Then whatever amount that you offered,
(32:05) which is called a tender, whatever amount that you tendered or offered is actually instantaneously removed off of
(32:12) the account as though it's a payment even if the the so-called payment is rejected.
(32:19) So it's actually very very funny. Uh you simply has to be made in good faith. So
(32:25) So all these letters, there's all these letters that are being sent out. So many letters. I see letters every single day
(32:32) and they always say the same thing. They say blah blah blah, you sent this thing in. It's not real. We don't accept this
(32:39) kind of payment. Uh you know, we you still owe us blah blah blah blah blah. It's pretty much that's the
(32:45) communication every single time. Uh we're starting to see now
(32:51) a little bit more detail. uh the Bridgecraft one and a couple other ones I've seen, they they go even farther and
(32:58) they say we do not accept any special or restrictive endorsements such as and
(33:04) they go on to say paid in full. They go on to say uh uh negotiable instruments.
(33:09) They'll say that right in the letter. Some some letters I've never seen that before. They're starting to get more
(33:15) specific, which is all still completely completely false information, but I do
(33:21) find it interesting that we're starting to see a little bit more detail in these letters. Well, that is quite
(33:26) interesting. And you know, I mean, this is an area that's very important to bring up. I mean, we we weren't
(33:32) necessarily going to talk about discovery, but there's something called interrogatories where you can submit a
(33:39) list of questions to the other party um basically to, you know, get at evidence
(33:44) of how they're going to yes address those issues and so asking some simple
(33:50) questions because they so for example, I've seen in court court testimony uh
(33:55) one time and and I think this might have been a small claims court where The judge asked the uh it was a plainif who
(34:03) was suing in this case I believe or maybe they were the defendant also actually um you know did you pay in US
(34:10) dollars? Now, this is quite interesting because all the negotiable instruments that we're talking about, they're all
(34:17) denominated in US dollars, right? They in fact the the coupon on your monthly credit card bill, right? It has a dollar
(34:24) sign right on it. So, there's really no difference uh between any of these
(34:29) things. They they accept checks, right? So, you can't say a check is a is a dollar bill Federal Reserve note, but
(34:36) it's US dollars because that's what it's denominated in, right? It's not uh a
(34:42) foreign currency. So any of these instruments, they're all equivalent. They're all denomin You're not going to
(34:47) write, you know, uh to pay in yuan on there or rupees. You you could though
(34:54) you could though and they have to accept it actually. You could you could because those are all negotiable instruments as
(35:00) well. They may have charge an fee for exchange but but nevertheless right be
(35:06) so this but this guy got nervous when the judge asked him this and he said no and then boom right after that it was
(35:12) like case over you didn't pay in US dollars right now he didn't say well you know I only had uh some croners and so
(35:21) hold on a second you're saying the defendant the defendant was asked that question uh uh and then the defendant
(35:26) said no the defendant was the one who tried to use an instrument to pay. I think that's too bad. That's too bad
(35:32) because he did pay in US dollars because the definition the definition of US dollars is very very simple. It's one of
(35:40) two things or both because you could you could technically use both to to as a as a payment for US dollars. It's either a
(35:46) bill of exchange which is defined as an unconditional order to pay or it's a promisary note which is defined as an
(35:51) unconditional promise to pay. Federal Reserve notes are promisary notes. Uh everything every currency pretty much is
(35:58) some sort of promisary note. There's only a few countries left that have real currency. So the thing is that you could send in any promisary note. You can even
(36:06) manufacture promisary notes and by definition that would be a payment for US dollars.
(36:13) And the and the and the the exact reference on that would be 18 USC8 which
(36:18) is uh obligations or other securities of the United States where they go they're very clear that all promisary notes,
(36:27) bank notes, bills of exchange are all obligations or other securities of the United States.
(36:34) Right? So, you know, this is a very good point and let me just break it down in simple as possible for people that all
(36:41) of the things that we think of are money are all negotiable instruments. Yes. And there's only there's two kinds of
(36:48) negotiable instruments, right? There's, as Brandon called it, bills of exchange. And we generally don't use that term as
(36:55) much in the United States anymore. It's generally referred to as for foreign negotiable instruments. But drafts is
(37:02) another word that you could use and that is an unconditional order to pay. And
(37:08) the other kind are notes or promisory notes. They mean the same thing and that's an unconditional promise to pay.
(37:15) So you have an order to pay and a promise to pay. Right? So that's simple. When we have a a dollar bill, a Federal
(37:21) Reserve note that is a note. So, it's a promise to pay and a check which we and
(37:28) we write a check that is a type of draft or related to a bill of exchange and
(37:33) that is an order to pay and we're actually ordering the bank who holds the account to pay the payee whoever that
(37:41) is. Yeah. So, so bills that you receive in the mail such as a bill that you
(37:47) receive from your uh utility company, it's called a bill. And whenever you see the word bill or billing department,
(37:54) that is a shortening for the full term called bill of exchange. Those statements or those bills or those the
(38:01) reason why they are called bills is because they are unconditional orders to
(38:06) pay a fixed amount with or without interest. It says, "Pay uh $57 by
(38:13) January 21st." That right there is an unconditional promise to pay. That
(38:18) actual bill that you receive at the end of the month is actually a you could actually convert that bill and send it
(38:24) in. You could take a bill from your telephone company, you can write some
(38:30) things on it, and you can mail it to your water company and it's actually a payment for US dollars. That's how
(38:36) insane. That's how insane the system that we have is. Brandon, let's just give an example like that people know
(38:42) from their everyday life of how you know you can do this because you know we've all written checks, right? So checks is
(38:49) a negotiable instrument that you can write on, right? You can write in the memo section. You can you have your
(38:55) endorsement on the back and you can actually if someone writes a check to you, you can actually write instructions
(39:03) on there to another party. Yes. Right. So, there's all kinds of things that that you can do. You just never kind of
(39:10) were given this rulebook. And here's here's the They don't want you to have it. That's right. It's the biggest
(39:17) thing. It's the biggest thing on the entire planet that they don't want you to have. I mean, I know you guys talk
(39:23) about a lot of things and and and the medical stuff and all that stuff. This what we're talking about right now on on
(39:29) the the top 10 list of things they do not want you to have. This is probably number one on all their lists. That's
(39:35) right. So, so these bills of exchange that they send you every month, right? Notice they have the positive balance on
(39:42) there. And here's where the confusion comes from, right? You think they're ordering you to pay them, but it may be
(39:49) that actually a different party is ordering a different party to pay. And
(39:55) so that's what you know what we have to figure out. It's that's in with an order
(40:00) to pay. There's three parties. So we have to figure out you know who's in each role and where do we fit in and
(40:07) then we can properly write the correct instructions on that and basically it
(40:13) becomes a check. Yeah. Right. Which I say use that term because it's familiar
(40:19) to you. It may be you know a demand draft or uh technically a slightly different thing but essentially it's a
(40:26) check. And even if you look at those coupons on the bottom, they have a
(40:31) string of numbers on the bottom. And the leftmost number is nine digits, right? Which is a routing number. Now, if you
(40:36) try to look that up under bank routing numbers, you won't find it because it's a private routing number. Um, and then
(40:42) you'll find after that the account number and also in there is often the amount of the minimum payment, right?
(40:49) Just like on a certified check. So that really contains all the elements of the
(40:55) check. And you can find this written about in the federal law um under uh the
(41:01) treasury regulations. So you can look for treasury circular 300 which is the
(41:07) prior version. Uh but it's an extensive document that you can find for download. And also in the CFR, the code of federal
(41:15) regulations, if you look up uh the area around restrictive endorsement, you'll
(41:20) find um they give you instructions of how you can give different instructions on these bills. And they'll also
(41:27) describe what the coupon is and give instructions about tearing it off or not
(41:33) tearing it off and uh about endorsing it. So you can, you know, actually find
(41:38) these things in the law. not, you know, we're not just making this up and hoping that it's a check. It it's right in
(41:44) there. Uh what we just may not know is the exact best way how to write these
(41:51) instructions and exactly who is the best individual to send it to to process it. And that's where we're running into the
(41:58) kind of problems uh compliance and enforcement, right? Right. So, so for example, I sent uh the instruments
(42:06) myself to several parties, but primarily to the chief financial officer of the
(42:12) bank. Uh but I also sent a copy to the regular billing department and also on
(42:19) the bill itself they list some additional numbers that you could send in certain circumstances. So, I sent it
(42:25) to all those places. Um, so that way, you know, there's redundancy and uh
(42:30) maybe someone might know, you know, what to do with it, although they didn't uh really know. But they never refused any
(42:37) of these instruments. They didn't send it back and ask for something different. Uh they really mostly ignored it. They
(42:44) they did send correspondence asking for another uh power of attorney uh from a
(42:50) separate department within the bank. That's interesting. I've never seen that. Interesting. Okay. And then they did send me notice that they closed my
(42:57) account so I could pretty common. Yeah, you were using the card and ultimately they sent me a charge off notice which
(43:04) is basically what they do is on their accounting books they write off the debt. Um so their books are balanced and
(43:12) it it doesn't show up as a loss or liability. However, they still pursue collection. So even after doing that
(43:19) they still that's when they decided to sue me um to uh collect you know what
(43:25) they think are unpaid debt. Yeah. And then just to give my my same
(43:31) same situation, same story, I did American Express for $177,000.
(43:37) I had uh on two cards, business cards, um like multiple businesses and and we
(43:44) kind of racked it up and then I around 90,000. These were under your personal
(43:49) uh social security credit, not on a business credit, right? Yeah. And um we
(43:55) were at about 90,000 and I said, "You know what? F it. I'm going to I'm going to just crank this thing up as high as I
(44:01) can go." I went on a shopping spree. I had a blast. I I furnished my whole apartment, bought a brand new TV. I
(44:07) bought all this great stuff. Uh computer parts and and and car parts and all
(44:13) sorts of good stuff, desks and uh I think even the camera I'm on right now I bought during that. Uh and and then uh
(44:22) also running a business and running a couple businesses and and all sorts of good stuff. We got up to about 177,000
(44:28) and then um and then I went for it. I said, I'm gonna I'm gonna this is it. I'm gonna go
(44:33) for it. Uh, I was very scared. I sent them, this was a, this was a long time
(44:38) ago. I didn't know a lot about a lot of this stuff. And I just sent them this freaking 25 page freaking
(44:47) uh, story book. It was like a It was like a a a It was like something out of
(44:53) a It was like a a combination of a story, combination of a of a philosophy
(44:58) text, combination of a of a love a love letter, combination of a hate letter. It
(45:04) was just this like craziness. And it had this whole thing about how I I I'm
(45:09) trying so hard to learn all this and I'm I'm going out there and I'm I'm helping to, you know, re rekindle America and
(45:15) rekindle the original America and I want American Express to be a part of it and I'm willing to uh uh actually help
(45:22) American Express be the pre premier uh creditor of the new world. And I was just like I was just like went off.
(45:28) Right. This this reminds me of the Jerry Magcguire memo. Yeah. Is that right? I I
(45:34) don't think I've ever seen that. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah, that was the the main story, right? He was uh working at this
(45:40) uh fancy sport uh you know, coaching thing where they had all the premier uh
(45:46) clients and he writes this memo and it's very inspirational like about you know, we can make this a great industry and
(45:53) such like that. And then they all basically said, get out of here. You're fired. That's that's basically what I
(45:59) did. Uh I didn't know any better. I was more of a writer than a litigator. Uh, so I went through my writing uh, eyes,
(46:07) you know what I mean? And I was like, okay, I'm going to impact them through my writing, right? And I just go on and
(46:12) on and on about, you know, and it's all in my course. I have the whole video breaking down this particular document.
(46:17) Uh, now I look back and I kind of chuckle a little bit, but it it was it was all part of the learning experience.
(46:22) I have no regrets. And then below that, uh, you know, I talk about the different statutes and the different things that
(46:29) were violated and that kind of thing. and I say, you know, there's going to be leans that I'll be filing if this is not complied with. Uh, but I was also very
(46:36) jokey and very light, but then at the same time, a couple of snippy parts in there. I tried to keep it not this
(46:42) heavy, nasty, threatening thing. Uh, so, so they sent me to Altran Collections
(46:49) and then they did hire an attorney, a law office. The law office sent me a
(46:55) letter. I sent I sent well no I sent that that was the first letter I had sent then it went to collections then it
(47:02) went to the attorney and then I wrote up a whole another thing that I sent to all the credit credit agencies to all and
(47:09) then also the the lawyer and then they after I sent that second letter they
(47:14) everybody dropped everything and the lawyer actually sent me a letter and I posted that letter on my website and
(47:20) that letter says you know hey we've decided uh we're not admitting anything guilt we're admitting that we've done
(47:26) anything illegal or we're not admitting that all has done anything illegal, but we all has made the business decision to
(47:32) not pursue this debt and we're also not going to report it. And I have that actual physical evidence of that letter
(47:39) posted on my website on my on the course signup page. If you scroll all the way down, you'll see that letter. So, um, I
(47:47) never I've never of all the crazy things I've done, that was the closest I ever got to litigation and, uh, it never
(47:54) happened. So, but it's it's kind of like to your point, it's sort of like, well, had it
(48:01) happened back then, I probably would be a star litigator now because I would have been I would have been thrown into
(48:06) the middle of the ocean and I would have had to swim my way all the way to to the shore. And honestly, there's almost a
(48:13) part of me wishes they would have sued me. Um, I would have been learning. I had a very
(48:19) similar experience that I was uh doing um a slightly different uh process uh
(48:25) based on equity um using the acceptance process for my property taxes on my uh
(48:34) prior home. I still have it now. But uh basically I began doing this and then I
(48:40) they basically sent me all these letters threatening tax foreclosure and uh then
(48:46) one of the uh the the assistant uh finance commissioner sent me this letter. You know, she said, "Stop
(48:53) sending all these notices of acceptance and dishonor." And you could tell from
(48:58) this letter that she she didn't understand like she had never looked it up in the law that this is a real thing.
(49:04) I think she thought I was just some guy making stuff up. So, so I decided it was
(49:10) the wrong the wrong people to talk to. They're the tax collectors, but they don't understand anything about the law.
(49:16) So, I found the county attorney who is in charge of property tax for the county. And then I found out who in the
(49:24) state gets involved with this. So I sent it to the state tax commissioner uh a copy and then also to um the controller
(49:32) of currency for the state and who they regulate financial matters and financial institutions. And I sent a notice of
(49:39) default and I went through like all of the the law including tender of payment
(49:45) by the way which is a very powerful yeah um section of the law uh in these cases.
(49:52) And once I sent that off, I got no reply
(49:57) at all. But I have not received any correspondence from them whatsoever
(50:03) related to any delinquent tax uh um uh bills or or liability. So they just sent
(50:11) me the regular like bill for this year. Uh but it didn't have any uh delinquent
(50:17) uh taxes on it. So that is sort of not an outright victory where they kind of
(50:23) admitted that uh okay your taxes are paid. Uh however they're they're not
(50:29) pursuing uh trying to steal my house. So um and send me harassing letters. So I
(50:36) consider that you know victorious uh for sure. Yeah. Totally.
(50:42) So um I think one of the things um to
(50:48) understand uh when you are dealing with this is exactly what what your role is. So I look at the you know my name in all
(50:57) capital letters as not exactly my name that that's an entity right perhaps even
(51:02) owned by some someone else like the government but that that's not the flesh
(51:07) and blood me because we don't write our names that way. And I think everybody who's looked into this space kind of has
(51:13) heard about the straw man concept. So in um you know signing and writing
(51:20) instructions on these negotiable instruments I did it as agent. Right now, agent is someone who has basically
(51:29) responsibility for entering into contracts for a principal in a trust.
(51:35) Um, and uh for doing basically like accounting and um you know those kinds
(51:42) of duties and the principal duty is actually to notify the principal of any
(51:47) notice that gets sent to the agent because they are like the liaison. Now they're different from a trustee because
(51:53) a trustee is the one who has the fiduciary duties uh of the trust. So in
(51:59) other words, paying the bills and such. In fact, a lawsuit is really the trustes
(52:04) responsibility. Um but we can sort of talk about that uh separately. But by delineating clearly
(52:12) to the court that I am the agent and not the principal, not the defendant, because this lawsuit is against the all
(52:18) caps name. it's not against me, the man. Um, and that's what one of the ways to
(52:26) delineate that is to say that you're there by special appearance and in and that means only to argue the matters of
(52:33) law and that you have no personal liability. And this is actually delineated in New York law. So, I was
(52:38) able to reference that. But if now in order to actually be like accepted at by
(52:46) the judge as the agent um there might be some further things that you have to do.
(52:52) So one possible way is if you have a power of attorney that is upheld. Um but
(52:57) also there's a process called ratification. But I just want you to know that if you're an agent and you get
(53:03) ratified which is something you can definitely achieve. In fact, I I think that when I was allowed to file that
(53:10) affidavit of service as agent that that actually ratifies me. Um but Oh,
(53:16) interesting. But um nevertheless, if you're ratified, that means you have no
(53:22) liability whatsoever. So, in other words, even if you lose the case, uh the judge will look to the
(53:29) trustee, another party to pay the damages, not you, because you're the agent. So you're not the responsible
(53:36) party. So this in in other words gives you immunity uh so to speak. That's
(53:41) right. Right. And this is just similar to the concept and you know many people think that this is valid if you go back
(53:48) to the congressional record of 1933 that all the property is actually owned by the government and that we are the
(53:55) beneficial you could say the beneficial owners are the beneficial users of the property. Right? So the property is for
(54:03) for our pleasure um but and uh we are supposed to be good
(54:08) custodians right by taking care of it um and preserving it for the future but uh
(54:13) technically it's not ours and some evidence of this may be where um eminent
(54:19) domain for example where the government can come in and and renovate you know take your property for their own use uh
(54:26) they do compensate you for the inconvenience right but it's not it's not the same way you'd be compensated if
(54:32) you owned it. You would be able to prevent it um in some way, right? But we don't have to get into the technical
(54:38) details, but just understand that if this is a way for you to remove yourself one degree from the case uh to protect
(54:46) yourself if you're able to do it um successfully. Yeah.
(54:53) So that being said, what I did was, you know, so I had to answer to these claims
(55:00) uh with defenses. Okay. So um now let me just preface this
(55:06) by saying first that like you Brandon, I didn't know much about the actual court procedure like what paperwork do you
(55:13) have to file that thing like the affidavit of service. I didn't know about I knew there was service but I
(55:19) didn't know that there was that kind of a document that needed to be filed. Right. So what I did as soon as I got
(55:25) served with the papers there is that there were some different phone numbers there on there for the local uh county
(55:32) courthouse and I just called them up and I said how can I you know get some help
(55:37) with the procedures. Now, you of course they're not going to tell you about legal strategies in the law like we're
(55:43) talking about tonight, but they sent me to the law library for the county. And I called them up and they said, "Oh, you
(55:49) let's make you an appointment." I went in there. There were three librarians. They weren't busy that day, I guess,
(55:55) that sat down with me. And they had already prepared uh actually and they
(56:00) handed me like templates for uh different responses that I could follow
(56:07) one template or the other. They asked me about if I was using any affirmative defenses. They gave me a document about
(56:14) affirmative defenses, right? They told they asked me about counter claims, right? They were super helpful. Um you
(56:22) know, and they told me exactly what papers to file and such. They even told me stuff that I didn't even technically
(56:27) have to do, right? And they answered all my questions and I'm going to, you know, continue to go back and get further
(56:33) information from them as the case goes on. They're an excellent resource. It's almost like they're your free
(56:39) parallegals. Uh I mean, they're not going to fill out documents for you, but you know, you say, "Oh, could you find
(56:44) some information on this?" They'll go find it and then and then give it to you. So, and they they really like, you
(56:52) know, doing this, especially if you're someone who, you know, is an nice
(56:57) generally speaking and not an I'm just laughing because I'm just thinking in the back of my head, a
(57:03) little plug for um for any lonely men out there who may have some failures with online dating. Go meet your local
(57:09) librarian. They want to get some get some feminine energy in your life. You know what I'm saying? There was only one
(57:16) one man in the library. They were all women. That's There you go. See, see, there you go. We got you. We got you
(57:21) here, you know. Yes, Brandon. You know, this is what this is your the male demographic,
(57:27) right? You always have to look for that angle. Yep. Yep. Yep. So, um, so what I did is because you
(57:35) know what I'm saying really, right? They're saying I violated the contract by not paying, but I did, right? I sent
(57:42) in lots of paperwork. actually way more than you would if you just sent a check each month. Um because what I did was,
(57:50) you know, I sent the instrument, right, that bill of exchange we were talking about with a cover letter with
(57:56) instructions. And the first time I did this, I also sent a power of attorney.
(58:01) And then when they didn't respond, I sent them a notice of dishonor,
(58:08) right? Because um non-payment is dishonor. and I you know they're they're
(58:13) part involved in paying um actually right so they're eligible for dishonor and that's in UCCC article 3 as well and
(58:22) and in after several months of this I actually went to the um length of filing
(58:29) a formal protest which is also known as a certificate of dishonor where a notary
(58:34) actually reviews the evidence that they I sent them these uh instruments in good
(58:40) faith And I then sent them a notice of dishonor and they still didn't respond.
(58:46) Um, and so that they are now officially in dishonor, adjudicated by a notary.
(58:53) And this is part of your notorial protest duties, which is required in every state's uh notary laws. And then I
(59:01) sent a copy of that to the secretary of state, who is the boss of all the notaries for your state. They're like
(59:06) the head notary. So that that's a a legal document, right, that's admissible as evidence.
(59:12) Um, so so I actually, right, sent them quite a lot of correspondence and it
(59:19) includes my, you know, noticing them that they're not actually doing what they're supposed to do, right, which is
(59:26) a type of dispute. So instead of a normal defense, right, where you where
(59:33) you kind of say, well, yes, I did that, but here's how why it's justified,
(59:38) right? Um, so for example, if I called them up and said, hey, I'm going to be, you know, on a expedition to Antarctica
(59:46) for the next 6 months and I won't be able to pay my bills. Uh, can you please send me a bill when I get back? And then
(59:53) they sue you while you're gone, saying you didn't pay your bills, right? I could defend that saying, "Hey, we had an agreement that I was going to be out
(1:00:00) of the country, right?" But in this case, I'm I actually did send in
(1:00:06) payments. So, I would use what's called an affirmative defense, basically
(1:00:12) saying, "I I actually did that, but you guys are cheating in some way, right?"
(1:00:17) And and the um what I chose to use to help with that is fraud.
(1:00:24) Okay? So essentially they're committing fraud by stating that there's this debt
(1:00:30) that I owe to them when in fact I have more than adequately fulfilled my
(1:00:36) performance obligation to satisfy that debt. And it gets even it gets even more
(1:00:41) exciting than that too just to chime in for two seconds. Um please every time you use your credit card uh you are
(1:00:48) promising to pay. It says right on the receipt that prints out every single time. every single credit transaction.
(1:00:54) If you think about if you want to go even crazier, see, it's it's so unrealistic to people.
(1:01:00) Everything is money. You are surrounded by money. I I I I was on my group the
(1:01:05) other day and I said I said to somebody, I said, "You are scuba Steve.
(1:01:11) You really are scuba Steve." Because you got to think about this. Every time you use your debit card,
(1:01:17) you are in that transaction. A debit card is essentially the same as an eche.
(1:01:23) A debit card transaction is an unconditional order to move funds.
(1:01:29) Right? A credit card transaction is an unconditional promise to pay funds.
(1:01:36) Right? So what's crazy is that every single transaction that you're doing,
(1:01:42) there's some sort of negotiable instrument that's either being
(1:01:47) manufactured or being transferred or being used in order to create that transaction. That's right. So you you
(1:01:54) you are the author of money and you are drowning in money. There is so
(1:02:02) much money in your life. Every single bill that you get is a positive number.
(1:02:08) Every single bill can be converted. All that positive value can be used. Uh uh
(1:02:15) every single credit card transaction, every single time you use your credit card, you're producing a promise to pay.
(1:02:21) When you sign that promise to pay and let's if I'd like to because this can be a little confusing. I want to break down
(1:02:27) the credit card transactions so that so that anyone who's listening to this, you can go look at these documents and see
(1:02:34) exactly how this flows. So, I'm going to step right over here for just a moment, get a drink, and I'm going to I'm going to be listening the whole time. Okay.
(1:02:40) All right. Great. So, I'll just I'll take the empty uh space off camera and
(1:02:46) talk about this for a minute. So, first you have your your card member
(1:02:52) agreement, right? which is your contract with the bank who's uh owns the account
(1:02:57) uh of your credit card. Now, in all these card members agreements, you'll find a section called promise to pay.
(1:03:05) And this is where it essentially states that, you know, I promise to pay all uh
(1:03:10) charges for all transactions for goods, services, etc. It might be worded slightly differently um in each card
(1:03:17) member agreement. Okay? So, you sign and execute that card member agreement in
(1:03:23) order to actually receive the card and begin using the account. Now, what happens when you make a credit card
(1:03:30) purchase? Okay. Now, you if you remember back in the day, you always had to s
(1:03:36) physically sign a piece of paper when you use your credit card for a purchase. Now, they have various electronics in
(1:03:43) the card that actually provides your signature uh electronically for you. and you you actually agreed to that in the
(1:03:50) card members agreement as well. And but if you you can still sign these receipts
(1:03:55) and sometimes you might have the occasion. So just take a look at what it actually says. Now, occasionally it does
(1:04:02) use the word promise, but most commonly, because I've studied these over the past uh months, it says, "I authorize this uh
(1:04:10) charge or this transaction." And and many times it references the card member
(1:04:15) agreement in the language below the signature line. And so what this is is it's referencing the promise to pay
(1:04:22) section. So it doesn't have to use the word promise on the document because it's on the master uh promisory
(1:04:29) agreement, right? Which is that card member agreement is really a master promisory note. And then each of these
(1:04:36) receipts is an is the uh actual promisory note with the amount on it,
(1:04:42) right? Because the card member agreement has no amount. And for a promisory note to be valid, it has to have um a an
(1:04:50) amount of uh money that's promised to be paid, including interest, right? And so
(1:04:56) that's on these little receipts. So those are your promisory notes. So what happens is um when those get
(1:05:06) back to the bank, we want to know how the funds actually move around. Right? Now, most people think what happens is
(1:05:12) is that the bank in their account, right, has a big fund and that each time
(1:05:18) you do a credit card charge, they take money out of that fund and pay the merchant um where you're shopping or you
(1:05:26) know the restaurant where you just had dinner. But that's not how it works at all. Um and how it works is um written
(1:05:34) about in the Federal Reserve Act section 16. um and look at the first two uh
(1:05:40) paragraphs of that section of the law. So, Brandon, I was just kind of told them the whole thing about the promise.
(1:05:48) Oh, okay. Great. Now, if you look in um paragraph 2, we'll just focus there uh
(1:05:53) for a second, right? It says that any member bank uh that's a member of the Federal Reserve, but I believe that
(1:05:59) banks who aren't members actually have work with member banks to do this for them.
(1:06:05) I believe personally that the all cap's name is a member bank, but that's a theory. Anyway, well, that that's
(1:06:11) interesting. And I even heard someone say that the all cap's name is a on the board of governors of the Federal
(1:06:17) Reserve. Well, think about this. Think about this and and and and I I don't want to lose the audience, but gosh, I
(1:06:22) love this conversation. Uh, think about this. If if if if
(1:06:28) your your all capital letter name is producing currency all the time, every time you use a credit transaction, every
(1:06:33) time you place that credit card in that machine or or tap it on a machine or tap it on a gas station, you're producing a
(1:06:39) brand new currency out of thin air. Didn't exist a second ago and now it does. It's called a promisary note. Uh
(1:06:46) if if you're if you're in legis, which is the Latin term for the the legal
(1:06:51) fiction all caps name straight out of the dictionary. Um, if your if your N's legis is not a bank,
(1:06:59) how is that currency being produced? It has to be a bank. Otherwise, this is like this is like massively massively
(1:07:07) illegal. And if you look inside of a lot of the definitions of bank or banking or banker, a lot of it has to do with
(1:07:14) credit transactions, creating credit transactions, being involved in credit transactions. almost every definition of
(1:07:20) bank or banking or banker I've ever seen if the ensle is it's almost like it's
(1:07:26) the chicken or the egg too. It's kind of like well hold on was it a bank and that's why it can produce currency or
(1:07:33) because it's producing currency it is a bank but I'm telling you it's one or the other it has to be by process
(1:07:39) elimination there's no there is no there's nothing to even talk about there's no argument there there can't be an argument yeah I mean you know Brandon
(1:07:46) if you look in UCC I think it's um article 9 uh it gives the definition of
(1:07:52) a bank right which is a person doing banking exactly right and No, that's
(1:07:58) what I So people always think, was it a bank, was it a bank before you put the
(1:08:04) credit card in the in the credit card machine or was it a bank? You know what I mean? But I'm telling you, it's it's
(1:08:11) one of it was either a bank before and that's why it produces or because it produces it is now. It's one or the
(1:08:16) other. It has to be. It has to be. There's no So what what Brandon is talking about here is as I was about to
(1:08:23) get to in that Federal Reserve Act, right? What the bank can do is that they
(1:08:29) can go to the Federal Reserve, right? They sometimes call this the Federal Reserve window um or their Federal
(1:08:35) Reserve agent that represents that bank from their regional Federal Reserve. And they basically apply to the Federal
(1:08:43) Reserve to get Federal Reserve notes. And they with the application they have
(1:08:50) to submit essentially a whole list of things, but they're really negotiable instruments. So, it's a uh you know, a
(1:08:57) bill, a draft, a promise, a note, a bill, u a all the same stuff. Y right.
(1:09:03) All those things, an unconditional order to pay or an unconditional promise to pay. It's always it's there's a bunch of
(1:09:08) different things, but all those various things fit into one of those two categories. Always. That's right. It's
(1:09:14) just one of those two and and it's so confusing when you say all the different things. So, I I'm starting to kind of go
(1:09:19) more towards teaching it just it's either an unconditional promise to pay or an unconditional order to pay and all
(1:09:26) those things and all the things they list and all these crazy banking terms and it either fits into one or or the
(1:09:32) other every single time. You know what I mean? That's right. And um essentially, you know, it could be a draft or a note,
(1:09:39) whatever it is, any of those instruments that they basically can take that instrument and trade it in for the exact
(1:09:47) amount of Federal Reserve notes as is on that instrument. And that instrument
(1:09:52) gets its power from our signatures, right, as agent for our principles. And
(1:10:00) so the the bank is actually using the note, right, that you signed,
(1:10:10) right, and they're cashing that in and then giving you back your own money and
(1:10:16) then asking you to pay them that amount a second time. It's it's like madness on
(1:10:22) top of madness on top of it's just like three or four layers of complete madness. And and it's when you when you
(1:10:28) start to in my own opinion, I'm starting to get a lot of clarity in the litigation, right? Because the litigation is is literally this simple
(1:10:35) for every single financial transaction from what I can tell so far is when you
(1:10:41) understand how all this works, it's very easy to develop some questions in your mind that you may have some curiosity as
(1:10:47) to what the hell happened, right? All you do is you you write up a complaint, which is pretty simple. You can look up
(1:10:52) a YouTube video on that. I will be producing a lot of material on this, by the way. You wait for the other party to
(1:10:58) answer the complaint and then you immediately motion the court, which means you you you write up an order to
(1:11:04) move the court. That's how the court system works is it's like a football field. You're trying to get down the football field to the various uh yard
(1:11:11) lines. And you're going to go into what's called discovery. Now, once you go into discovery, you can start asking
(1:11:16) these questions. Now they they these questions when you actually understand how all this stuff works these questions
(1:11:24) make them very uncomfortable and the more questions that you ask just
(1:11:29) literally you're just like I mean I don't even recommend that you go online and find my questions. What I want to do
(1:11:35) is I'm going to be teaching people how to really be curious about this and how to develop their own questions because when you when you're really curious and
(1:11:41) you really have questions what happened in my original promisary note, what did you guys do? When was it taken to the
(1:11:47) Federal Reserve? Subpoena the Federal Reserve. Get them to to prove you guys swapped this. When did you swap it? Let
(1:11:53) me see the papers. I want to see it. By that point, they are sweating, man. They are sweating and they are running,
(1:11:59) right? So, so when you when you when you understand all of this, that's why we said earlier this stuff never goes to
(1:12:05) trial because if you get into discovery, all you're going to do is just like a kid in a candy store uh like asking dad,
(1:12:11) "Daddy, daddy, what's um what's this?" And daddy, daddy, what's this? What's this? Daddy. Daddy. What's That's it.
(1:12:17) That's all you have to do. Literally. And and and you will win. I've never heard of anyone doing that. Not winning
(1:12:23) ever. Ever. And And I've seen so many examples where they do a very poor job
(1:12:29) of it. The questions are poor. The the the sentences are poor. The grammar is poor. Everything is poor. They don't
(1:12:37) really have a good grasp, but they kind of sort of in the dark go in this
(1:12:43) direction and do this. and they they win every single time. They settle immediately. They don't want just please
(1:12:48) make it stop. You know what I mean? That's that's kind of their reaction. So, what's so fascinating about this conversation is it's it's kind of a lot
(1:12:54) farther than than what anyone's really talking about right now in this space. Um you you you're not going to find
(1:13:00) hardly anyone talking about this anywhere. That's right. We're we're breaking
(1:13:06) ground. And yeah, it's big time. what you just described in the way to ask questions, you know, that's kind of like
(1:13:12) the country lawyer tactic. Yeah. Where you you basically like, you know,
(1:13:17) pretend that you're totally ignorant about what's going on and you're, you know, like you're a member of the jury,
(1:13:24) so to speak, right? Yes. And or a country bumpkin and just say, "Well, okay. So, I come into the bank and I
(1:13:31) fill out an application for a loan, right? What do you do with that application?" and just take it very slow
(1:13:37) like that, right? And it's very, you know, every single step you want to know. And that that's how you're going
(1:13:43) to get to the bottom of this. And I also want to, you know, talk about, well, what evidence do you request because I I
(1:13:51) showed this to you uh in private, Brandon, but in a separate matter uh related to a uh a mortgage e
(1:13:59) um I asked for a bookkeeping entry that shows the I well, what I specifically
(1:14:06) asked for was show that the loan funds were a pre-existing asset of the bank
(1:14:12) and then demonstrate that those loan funds were transferred into my account.
(1:14:18) Uh right, giving me the loan. Now, um they they couldn't do either, but they
(1:14:23) did send me the bookkeeping entry showing the the loan from their account
(1:14:28) from the bank's general uh fund uh they called it, I think. And this was
(1:14:34) fascinating because there were not one but there were two entries, right? There
(1:14:40) was a deposit and a withdrawal, a credit and a debit, an asset and a liability
(1:14:46) simultaneously. And what this was right was this was they took my promisory note
(1:14:52) went to the Federal Reserve window or you can you can also exchange it at the treasury in different ways. But they did
(1:14:58) this. They got the funds right that were generated by my signature on the note. I essentially gave them an instrument
(1:15:05) worth that much uh funds. So they got that that that's the deposit that went
(1:15:10) into their account. Then they took those funds and they transferred them out. Now they didn't put them in my account. They
(1:15:17) gave them to a third party actually which I didn't authorize but that's kind of a separate matter for that case. But
(1:15:24) here right the the exact evidence. So I could go and say hey how could you give
(1:15:30) me a loan if you have no net liability on your books? You you're neutral right?
(1:15:37) And then that would violate the actual fabric of a contract itself, which states that there has to be equal
(1:15:42) consideration to have a contract. Yeah, exactly.
(1:15:47) There's a lot there's a lot here. We're kind of we're kind of uh I have a feeling we're kind of killing off your
(1:15:53) audience here, but it's good. I mean, this is this is all this is all so true. And for people who there's a lot of
(1:16:00) really advanced stuff that we're talking about. Um, and I and I and I just want
(1:16:05) to I think that a lot of people might be kind of lost or kind of in and out on this one. Uh, but but it just kind of is
(1:16:12) what it is. Uh, you know, we can definitely have additional conversations on this, but this is uh there's a lot of
(1:16:18) there's a lot of this is going to be probably better for my audience to be honest with you. Well, uh, my audience
(1:16:24) is going to go ballistic over this one. Uh, so Brandon, let's simplify it because I we're really talking about two
(1:16:30) two aspects here, right? One is we're saying, right, there is no real money. Yes. So, we're going to use the paper
(1:16:37) that you send us and try to figure out the proper way to work within this
(1:16:42) system, right? And we're honoring that the way that you're obligated to do. Yeah. In 1933, they took away the gold
(1:16:49) and silver coins, which the Constitution says is the only way to pay. In exchange, they gave us all infinite
(1:16:54) credit. Nowadays, circa 2024 quote infinite credit end quote or US
(1:17:02) dollars quote end quote are defined as two things. They're defined as an unconditional order to pay or an
(1:17:08) unconditional promise to pay. Both of those things are called negotiable instruments. The word instrument means
(1:17:14) document or contract. The word negotiable means transferable.
(1:17:19) That's basically literally the entire the entire thing in a nutshell. It's so simple when you explain that way that
(1:17:26) it's people are like it can't be that this can't be. They there's a lot of emotional rejection seriously and and I
(1:17:32) went through it, you know, and everyone goes through it and it's okay. I understand that. That's that's the most difficult part of all of this now. I
(1:17:40) feel like cuz when I explain it to people, I know I'm on the right track when what I get back is a completely
(1:17:46) emotional response. I'm like, "Okay, good. That's good." because that means the information, the factual information
(1:17:52) was understood and it triggered an emotional defensive response. Right? So it's like am I getting a a a a negative
(1:17:59) reaction on the information side or am I getting a negative reaction on the
(1:18:05) emotional side right now? The emotional side that rejection can be overcome by grounding the information and letting
(1:18:11) them know how does this benefit you. Once they understand once once a person understands the benefits then what
(1:18:19) happens is they allow the emotional blockage to release because the thing is is that the emotional blockage is there
(1:18:25) because of I've been this dumb for this long. I've been wrong my whole life.
(1:18:31) I've been working so hard for these stupid things and now I'm just an idiot. But but once you can once you
(1:18:37) say no no don't worry about all that. Everyone's in the same boat. Don't worry about all that. It's all fine. You're fine. this is the benefit that's going
(1:18:44) to happen to your life if you if you just drop those emotional barriers and move forward and try to understand this
(1:18:49) stuff and move forward into trying to do this stuff. To me, that's been the most successful avenue. And I'm able to get
(1:18:56) people just over the over the factual bar uh and then over the emotional bar
(1:19:01) like that, right? And that's how I do it. I do it by by grounding the information and saying this is what you
(1:19:07) can do with this information. for example, every bill, every promisary note,
(1:19:12) everything. You can go out and buy a car right now, taking the information from this video that we've explained so far,
(1:19:18) which is a little bit convoluted, a little bit all over the place, but it's okay. It's our first time talking together. And and and you, by the way,
(1:19:25) by the way, for my audience, I I don't think I've ever seen documentation as
(1:19:32) well as I've seen Dr. Kaufman's information. I mean, it's it's the the the the the complaint that you sent me
(1:19:40) was I mean, 10 stars. I mean, just just and and it's 10 stars just objectively
(1:19:48) like subjectively in relation to everything else I see. It's a it's a trillion stars. But but just taking all
(1:19:54) that out out and just just just just non-relative just straight up like it's
(1:19:59) 10 stars. It's 10 star. It's so far beyond anything that no one is going to be able
(1:20:06) to comprehend what you've written. It's it's just way too far above the anybody
(1:20:12) that you're going to come in contact with. It's so and and that's and that's the problem that I have is that I I I
(1:20:19) I'll show you my complaint later privately. Mine is like dumb. Mine is
(1:20:24) like like kindergarten. It's like it's like so so the way a complaint is written, we can get back into this a
(1:20:30) little bit if you don't mind. The way the way a complaint is written is very very simple. People think and I thought
(1:20:36) too, this is what I thought when I first when when your first document when you first file I thought it had to have
(1:20:42) everything in the kitchen sink. You got to have you got to collect it all together. It's got to be a book. It's
(1:20:47) got to be, you know, it's not like that at all because the the word allege, so so a complaint, that first document
(1:20:54) you're going to file in a lawsuit is called allegations. Now, the definition of allege or allegation is the key to
(1:21:00) everything. It's it's setting forth that of which the person intends to prove.
(1:21:09) You're not proving it right now. What you're doing is you're saying, I have evidence over here.
(1:21:16) this is all the stuff that I intend on proving and then you send that and they
(1:21:22) have to answer that and then you start to bring in the evidence and you start to prove everything and that's that this
(1:21:29) is the way that the court system so you can get these things rolling like boom boom you can do a complaint and you can
(1:21:35) send it in and then you're already over here organizing your evidence you're not even done with that yet you're just like
(1:21:40) you're just like boom it's out they have to okay and now you're over here getting your evidence together so it can go fast
(1:21:46) I thought I thought at first I had to have the whole planet in order. I thought I had to align all the stars
(1:21:52) before I could file a complaint. Right? So, and my complaint is very simple. My complaint is like we had a contract.
(1:22:01) Uh uh some of the items in this particular interaction are negotiable instruments.
(1:22:07) Negotiable instruments are defined as blank. This document
(1:22:13) was uh this document is an unconditional promise to pay. This document was
(1:22:18) written. This document was signed. Next document. This document is an
(1:22:24) unconditional order to pay. This document next line. This document was signed. Next line. This document was
(1:22:32) written. Literally. That's the way my complaint is. It's like this is what a this is can we agree? This is what the
(1:22:38) definition of of a promisary note is. and it has three different elements. And then I say, "Okay, this document has
(1:22:44) this element, this element, and this element." And that's the whole complaint all the way down the entire complaint.
(1:22:49) That's all it is. There's really nothing else in it. I made it so dumb that it was like a 5-year-old could look at it
(1:22:55) and be like, "You're screwed, man. There's no way around this one." You know? No. Listen, you know, right?
(1:23:01) Brevity is the soul of wit. So if you can use concision uh to craft your
(1:23:06) document, it it's definitely going to be helpful. And the you know the reason why
(1:23:12) you can't you couldn't possibly make all your arguments in the complaint because you're going to obtain evidence through
(1:23:18) the course of discovery and it's you don't know what you can prove, right? So what you want to do is add things that
(1:23:25) you think you you're not sure you could prove, but you might be able to because later on if you don't prove them, they
(1:23:31) just get dropped. But if you don't mention it, there is they won't let you bring new uh arguments on at some point
(1:23:38) or new causes of action, right? So, but you could just put them in a list. You don't need to give all the reasoning. Uh
(1:23:45) just very very bare bones. So, even this complaint, right, that was served to me.
(1:23:50) Um it's only two pages. Yeah. It's and and I think there's an exhibit attached.
(1:23:55) This is a lot of the information that I like to and this is all the information that's going to go into the my my pro
(1:24:01) living course because I I I I'm trying to break the illusionary spell that
(1:24:09) litigation is akin to climbing Mount Everest with with no rations
(1:24:19) and no friends by yourself, which is which is pretty much what people think it is, including myself. I thought that
(1:24:24) as well. Um, and it's not even it's it's like it's like it's like stepping on an
(1:24:31) antill. Uh, but but it all comes down to perception. Perception is reality obviously, right? So so so
(1:24:39) I like to talk about things and to give information that breaks that illusionary
(1:24:44) reality. And the and the illusionary the the the true piece of information is you can just
(1:24:51) I mean kind of slap this thing together. Uh as long as you believe you can put
(1:24:57) together coherent information in the next 30 to 60 days,
(1:25:03) you can just kind of slap this thing together. I mean, you could you could just type up something in five freaking
(1:25:09) minutes and send it into the court. Now, Brandon, this th this um complaint and
(1:25:14) summons that you filed, was it for a similar situation where you um paid with negotiable instruments or a conditional
(1:25:22) acceptance or No, no, this one is this one is pretty wild. So, so it's a it's a
(1:25:27) real estate deal where there's all these these purchase agreements and there's all these and I'm claiming all of them
(1:25:33) as negotiable instruments and I'm rescending all of the blank negotiation on all of them and I'm forcing a a a
(1:25:41) realy company to convert all of them at the Federal Reserve window into Federal
(1:25:47) Reserve notes and deposit them into an escrow account. So, I I I I'm going like a pretty high Yeah, you're Yeah, you're
(1:25:53) you're going for the gold right away. I'm going for the I I you know, I this thing fell on my plate. It's a client of
(1:25:59) mine uh at the at the I have a law firm at a law office. It's it's it's something that kind of fell in my lap.
(1:26:05) Uh the the lawyers on the defense side kind of pissed me off and and the the the client was just, you know, ready to
(1:26:12) go, very level-headed, uh very well educated, and I just said, you know what, f it. I'm going for it. and and I
(1:26:20) just that's this is our first lawsuit, you know. Uh it's okay. It is it is a
(1:26:25) bit complicated, but it's okay. I am I feel I feel 100% ready for it. If if not
(1:26:32) actually I feel like I've I've not not regrettably, but I feel like I I've been a little bit pussyfooted. I I've been I
(1:26:38) I should have done this a while ago. Not not on a regret form, but I I'm ready. I feel super ready for this, so I'm going
(1:26:44) for it. Well, look, it I don't think it's ever a bad idea um to delay things
(1:26:49) and do a little bit more preparation, especially for the people we're talking
(1:26:54) to here, right? Like, for example, if this is, you know, and I I was assuming
(1:27:00) that most of the people who would view this already know a lot of this and maybe have even done some of these
(1:27:05) processes to pay bills, but have never gone to court. But don't start sending
(1:27:10) paperwork to creditors until you understand what you're doing. Oh yes, I say that all the time. So if you've done
(1:27:17) it already, you should know understand what we are talking about in terms of the uh the legal arguments. Even though
(1:27:23) the the stuff that we're talking about about litigation, you know, is a different matter. I the the way I look
(1:27:29) at it just real quick on that because I think this is such an important thing to talk about. Um, my my personal
(1:27:34) communication on this is you're I'm I'm I have never been 100% when I take
(1:27:41) action, I've been like 80 to 85% confident. And I feel like it's just a
(1:27:47) ratio. You know what I mean? Like like for me, 80 to 85% I know that I'm going
(1:27:53) to unlock that remaining 20% when I when I take action. So, it's like I hit 80%
(1:27:59) logically and then emotionally I know that the remaining 20% I need to move forward to get the the remaining 20%.
(1:28:06) Right? And I think there's a lot of people who they're they're at 20% and they take action and then they crash and
(1:28:12) burn and they splatter all over the street and then you have the 100% people who never ever take action because
(1:28:17) they're waiting for something that will never happen. So, I think for every single individual there's a there's a ri
(1:28:22) there there's some middle ground. there's a ratio where where where the the logical information is at a peak
(1:28:29) point. It's the emotional understanding that that I feel like you're not you're just simply not going to hit that until
(1:28:36) you force yourself to move through the wall of fire and and and do what needs
(1:28:41) to be done. And that that it's the emotional side that will correct and clarify as you gain that confidence
(1:28:47) through action. And for me that that ratio is around 80 or 85%. So I think in
(1:28:53) my head, am I am I 80%. If I am, I just take action. It's like a policy for me. I just take action at around 80%.
(1:29:00) Period. If I'm not 80%, I don't I just don't. It's like I It's like a a
(1:29:05) completely unthinking, totally logical uh uh flag in the ground. It's like no
(1:29:12) matter what, if I'm below 80, I'm like, nah. If I'm above 80, it's action time. Period. That's how I do it. And you
(1:29:18) know, you could say a threshold would be just if you can explain it to another individual who's unfamiliar with this
(1:29:27) area of the law, right? And get them to understand it, then you definitely know it well enough to do the process. That's a good point. That's very well enough
(1:29:34) to, you know, you may brush up on it to go into court, right? But uh but that that's I I think a good standard. Like
(1:29:41) you you did that show with uh the gentleman who uh was successful uh with a credit card. Um, and that's what
(1:29:48) happened to him since, right? But he was that was a dice roll and we we got a we got a six. You know what I mean? We hit
(1:29:54) the, you know, that was But yes, so he he was a great example because, right,
(1:29:59) he definitely knew the material well enough to write his own very simple instruction letter, right? And um I I
(1:30:07) think we were both impressed by the how um to the point that was, right? It was
(1:30:12) like one sentence and enough to get the job done. Even when they called him, it was like a two-minute phone call and and
(1:30:18) his instructions was like one sentence. Yeah. I think I think that definitely contributed to because because in in
(1:30:26) this space, everyone's sending letters to the chief financial officer or the indentured trustee or this person, that
(1:30:31) person or God or who else. This dude just sends it into the billing department, which is like unheard of.
(1:30:37) You know, I've sent everything to the billing department. Um but I've sent it to multiple parties. Yeah, he just did
(1:30:45) the building department. Well, he actually he made up a department,
(1:30:50) remember? He he put something like remittance department, but they didn't have one like but he just put that on
(1:30:56) the envelope and remember address from the normal billing thing. Yeah. So, but
(1:31:01) but you know, like if you're able to do that, like you you don't need to follow
(1:31:07) a template. You can write your own cover letter, right? Even if it's not perfect,
(1:31:12) I'd say that's also a good bar, right? And we should and and it's it's good to
(1:31:17) have other people's templates, especially when they're good, because we can't always think of everything, right?
(1:31:23) And we might uh look at that and say, "Oh, I want to I want to, you know, utilize that phrase or that sentence,
(1:31:29) but but we shouldn't be just copying everything word for word and using everything like that, right? We need to
(1:31:36) if we understand this, we can write it. Or we might get a template from someone else and say, you know what, I'm not
(1:31:42) sure this part's correct. I'm going to I'm going to look it up and I'm going to correct it. Right? And because you can't
(1:31:48) you can never guarantee that what anyone else has done is going to be successful,
(1:31:54) is accurate, right? Unless you have checked everything yourself or, you know, you've you've created it yourself.
(1:32:01) So, it's very tempting to like see the the potential here and just grab
(1:32:07) something and run with it, but that's where you're going to later on have a moment uh of uh fear and regret most
(1:32:14) likely. So, just understand it at a basic level of competency that you could talk about it that you could write a
(1:32:20) simple and we're talking about less than a one-page letter here. Uh so, this is not like uh Brandon's, you know, 24page
(1:32:28) document that he sent to American Express. We don't you we don't it was all part I'm not I'm I laugh a little
(1:32:34) bit in in slight embarrassment I guess but it's it's just all part of the learning process for me. Uh you know I'm
(1:32:39) not really embarrassed. I just I just look back and it's just it's just kind of humorous in my opinion. But yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You don't need to you don't
(1:32:45) need to you don't need to write a short story. Uh you don't need to write a micro novel which I did. Uh seriously.
(1:32:55) But you know what what we really have here right in this system is just it's all it is is is paper moving around
(1:33:01) right you sign a paper you give it to the bank they give it to another bank
(1:33:06) that they give them paper back they give you different paper right and and all of
(1:33:12) that paper the value that we perceive you know it's really ironic because we feel that you know we have to go out and
(1:33:19) and give our time and our energy and our work right to get those notes notes uh
(1:33:26) in order to live. But we never stop and say, you know, where do those notes really come from? Right? We might assume
(1:33:32) that they're backed by gold or that, you know, some bank just has the authority to at will print them and create them,
(1:33:40) but it's actually us. We are the ones who create all that value, right? It all
(1:33:47) comes from us signing one of those pieces of paper. Then that paper becomes
(1:33:52) the value and they can just trade it for any form that they want. They could trade it for another promisory note.
(1:33:59) They could trade it for a check or a draft. They could trade it for Federal Reserve notes. They could trade it for securities like ownership securities,
(1:34:06) right? Stocks, bonds, and all of these things go on, right? But the the one source of all of that, right, comes from
(1:34:13) us and the energy from our signature. So really you know and I know this is a is
(1:34:20) a tall order to accept right but we have been cheated. Now it doesn't mean you
(1:34:26) shouldn't work right because we have to be productive um in our life and even to fulfill the duties of generating this
(1:34:33) paper it still is work right we have to if we do it really responsibly we have to do accounting for it right we have to
(1:34:40) answer all notices and um uh communicate that information appropriately and such
(1:34:46) and that is our labor right and for the fruits of that we're entitled to live with the benefits um so I'm not saying
(1:34:53) that you should resent that you have been productive in your life. It's just
(1:34:58) that you didn't realize the value that you bring to the table. And so now you
(1:35:03) can take this information and change the equation. So that you right because
(1:35:09) we're all meant to live in abundance. It's just that we have been treated as
(1:35:15) children and children get allowances. They can't be trusted to have all the
(1:35:21) resources, right? They have trust funds for rich kids so they don't go and blow all all the money, right? Because it's
(1:35:28) supposed to last the rest of their life. And we are essentially have all been in this system been treated like children
(1:35:35) that we cannot be trusted. So we're given these allowances and we're told to
(1:35:40) do the chores, right, which is our nine-to-five jobs. But so once we
(1:35:46) understand this and come out of it and rise up to be competent adults,
(1:35:52) well now we can take the responsibility to manage the resources ourselves. And
(1:35:57) that means that we get access to the full resources which as you say are
(1:36:03) practically infinite. Yeah. I mean I say infinite money on all my
(1:36:08) stuff just because that's literally like a video game term. I'm not I'm not kidding. That's why I
(1:36:15) that's why I say it. That's exactly why I say it. It's it's just a you know, but it is it is really the real life
(1:36:23) monopoly, right? Because we have that, right? There are the rules, right? That we we can't in our incompetent state, we
(1:36:31) can't exchange our promisory notes directly for Federal Reserve notes, right? we need to go and beg the banker
(1:36:39) to, you know, do it for us because they're our trustee in that matter or our fiduciary
(1:36:44) and that means they have certain responsibilities to us, right? But we can't do it on our own in these rules
(1:36:50) until we demonstrate competency and then perhaps if we ask, we'll actually be
(1:36:56) given access to do it directly ourselves. Yeah.
(1:37:02) Yeah. It's a whole it's a whole experience of self-discovery and uh you
(1:37:07) know it's a people want to go to school for you know four five 6 7 8 years and then come out
(1:37:15) and then build a career which takes several years. Uh this is basically kind
(1:37:20) of the same idea but it's it's it's compounded into maybe two years. Uh it's
(1:37:26) it's basically your 2-year school all the way through career building option that costs nothing
(1:37:35) upfront and it takes about two years I'd say at this point in time which is a lot less than it ever has been because of
(1:37:40) all the resources available. Uh we've never ever I would say two years if you really do it full-time during those two
(1:37:47) years. Oh yeah, of course. I I mean if you but but I'm saying if you were to focus on it as much as you'd focus on
(1:37:52) let's say a college degree, right? Or I I would say more like a master's degree or even law
(1:37:59) school because you know law school is three years, right? And and they don't even touch on this material. Yeah. So so
(1:38:06) something like along that same idea is what it's going to take to get yourself
(1:38:12) into a position where uh everything is money. Literally everything is money.
(1:38:18) I'm not even kidding. Um, you create money with your fingertips. Your pens create money. Everything anyone sends
(1:38:25) you is money. Uh, that's basically the life that I live. Um,
(1:38:31) and the problem is is getting anyone else to realize that everything is money
(1:38:36) and that I'm sending money and that I'm creating money. That's the part that I'm having a hard time with and that's the
(1:38:43) part where litigation comes in. And that's why I'm learning litigation essentially. That's right. Because you
(1:38:49) know even if you now because I've done quite a bit of this since I've learned this law is that I've looked at
(1:38:56) financial pundits and experts that and not and I don't even go to you know CNN
(1:39:01) or Fox News or the Wall Street Journal. I'm looking in more in the alternative financial um you know gurus who have
(1:39:09) large platforms you know on the usual places like YouTube and they give quite
(1:39:14) you know detailed commentary but you can find a lot of them talking about how the banking system and finance works and you
(1:39:22) know they have these uh there's sort of like the lay um understanding which is
(1:39:27) you know that the banks actually have their own money and they lend it to you and you pay them back right and
(1:39:33) everybody Everybody in banking knows that's not what's going on. But what they think is that it's all about
(1:39:39) fractional reserve lending and that the banks have money but they only but they can lend out way more than they have.
(1:39:45) Right? But that's but that's not wrong either. And there are very very few. You can find one or two of them in
(1:39:52) interviews here and there that will actually explain how the banking system
(1:39:58) like what we're talking about today. what I what we talked about before about how they just create the money based on
(1:40:03) our our promisory note when we apply for a loan right so there are but because
(1:40:09) only a few even elite bankers really understand this or at least they're willing to talk about it on an interview
(1:40:16) right that's why it's an uphill battle but if we you know like in my uh lawsuit
(1:40:23) for example right if if if it goes to discovery where I get to um depose owes
(1:40:30) people on their side, right? Because the the chief financial officer for the bank is a party to the lawsuit because I sent
(1:40:38) the bills to that individual. So that means I could if necessary subpoena that
(1:40:44) individual to come or me go to them for a deposition
(1:40:49) um to answer questions in this case because there's a part they're in the party in the case and they sued me. So of course I have the right to
(1:40:56) cross-examine my accuser. now, which is their literal Well, I'm sure I want to
(1:41:02) say worst nightmare. I want to say worst nightmare, but but I
(1:41:08) frankly with the amount of research I've done so far, I I'm not even sure what
(1:41:16) the CFO knows. Well, it it doesn't matter because one thing is, you know, the CFO of one of the major banks in the
(1:41:23) United States to have to sit and spend hours giving testimony for a $5,000
(1:41:29) lawsuit like I Oh, no, no, no. That's never I don't think the company will will let that fly in the first place,
(1:41:34) right? Yeah. But getting beyond that like even if he doesn't know then he would have to claim ignorance about the
(1:41:41) basic the very basic mechanics of banking which he's in charge of all of
(1:41:47) the financial operations. So that would make him look quite bad and then I would be able to say okay well who in your
(1:41:56) company does know the answer to these questions so that I could depose them or do you have you know written policies
(1:42:02) that discuss this? Who's your, you know, Federal Reserve agent that you deal with? Yeah. These are, by the way, these
(1:42:08) are questions. These are these are qu you're you what what what you just said right there. That's the most deadly. I
(1:42:14) mean, that is just I mean, you're they they would rather have you take a knife and jam it in their chest. They would ra
(1:42:22) they they they had to choose between a knife in the chest and those questions you just asked. Give me the knife. Give
(1:42:28) me if it's a full if it's a full metal jacket 9 millimeter round it's probably going to be less painful than the
(1:42:34) questions that Dr. Kaufman just asked. So give me give me the 9 millm round of the chest. These are hollow point questions. Yeah. Yeah. Um you know
(1:42:42) they're they're really uh these are 300 win mag questions.
(1:42:47) Yes, they really are. They really are. And when you realize that this is it's just that simple, man. you start getting
(1:42:53) the right questions and you curious, you know, there's a a case, I believe it was
(1:42:59) in Minnesota and it was a jury trial um and but the judge was a justice of the
(1:43:05) peace and later this case was vacated by the state supreme court and but you can
(1:43:11) still find it um you know I I forget the name of it but basically what happened is that this whole thing was exposed
(1:43:17) that it was a a lawyer who defaulted on his mortgage and there was was a
(1:43:23) foreclosure uh proceeding. And at trial, this lawyer put the president of the
(1:43:28) bank up on the stand and basically got him to answer all these questions uh
(1:43:35) that I just described um about, you know, that that he never got a loan. And the jury unanimously
(1:43:42) um ruled, you know, in favor of this guy who was being foreclosed upon, right?
(1:43:48) And but you could tell from reading about this case that the everyone was so
(1:43:55) afraid of this ruling uh being upheld that they found some technicality to
(1:44:01) overrule it and get rid of it. So it could never be used um as case law for
(1:44:06) another case. It can only be sort of talked about, right? But but you see the
(1:44:12) effect that it had on the jury because as soon as a jury of your peers, right? And I I'm going to definitely demand
(1:44:19) that this be a jury trial, right? Most of these cases would not. They would be
(1:44:25) just have the judge decide, but no, no, no. I mean, I want the jury to be able to find out how the banking system is
(1:44:31) fraud, right? So they would, if I was able to get this testimony and, you
(1:44:39) know, have this trial play out, it would be in the public record, right? That means I could call up, you know, all the
(1:44:46) news media the next day and say, "Hey, you know what the the CFO of, you know,
(1:44:52) the largest one of the largest banks in the nation said at trial? Here's the transcript." You know? Yeah. Right. I
(1:44:59) mean, it's on the record. It's not I'm, you know, I didn't make anything up. They can quote it directly, right? And
(1:45:06) that'll be a juicy story that somebody is going to pick up. Maybe it'll be a
(1:45:11) local news channel because, you know, the the bigger ones may be uh told not to report on that, right? But but they
(1:45:19) don't want to take a chance. And so if I if I can demonstrate that I can ask the
(1:45:25) right questions and and elicit this information and also ask for the evidentiary record like that bookkeeping
(1:45:32) entry for example which could also be called an audit trail um and correlate
(1:45:37) those things. It's like they they would be taking such a huge public relations risk right because you know what if they
(1:45:45) if it comes out in court right that they don't lend anybody any money. Yeah. What do you think all the other card holders
(1:45:51) are going to do? I'm not paying them anymore. Yeah. Exactly. You know, not the normal way anymore. Yeah. Yeah. So,
(1:45:58) so they would, you know, I think most likely want to settle with me. But, but
(1:46:03) I actually have a little strategy in place as a fail safe for that because
(1:46:09) let's say that they sue me and I write a response and it's really strong and they look at it and they they realize, oh, we
(1:46:16) didn't really want to put all this work in for a $5,000, you know, debt, so
(1:46:22) we'll just dismiss the case. We'll drop it. We'll let him off the hook. Well, they can't do that with me because I
(1:46:30) filed counter claims. Yeah. So, right, a counter claim means, you know, not only
(1:46:36) are you suing me and it's it's not really uh the merits aren't there, but
(1:46:42) actually you're in the wrong and I'm going to counter sue you, right? So, now they can't they can't dismiss it because
(1:46:49) they have to answer to those counter claims, right? So the only way they could get out of it is by negotiating
(1:46:55) and offering me something to dismiss the counter claims. Exactly. That's that's
(1:47:00) one thing I've been talking about from my people. Yeah. It's always it's so important. You always want to go on the
(1:47:06) offensive as quickly as possible. If you that's what I've been talking about to all my people in the past week or two.
(1:47:12) If you're ever sued, you want to get a counter claim in immediately. Everyone, everyone in this space of
(1:47:19) legal and law and and negotiable instruments and all this stuff that we're talking about, my whole platform, everybody on it, everybody in every
(1:47:26) single group is so worried about defense, defense, defense, defense. I'm being sued. I'm being sued. I got pulled
(1:47:33) over. You, everyone needs to understand that you want to turn you being the
(1:47:40) defendant into you being the plaintiff as rapidly as possible. and you want to
(1:47:46) go on the offensive and you want to counterattack as rapidly as possible if you can be the first one to attack and
(1:47:53) you can be the plaintiff before you are the defendant, it's always better. You you always want to and the thing is when
(1:48:00) you realize how much fraud is here and every single one of these things, all this stuff is so rife with fraud, you
(1:48:06) can turn around and come at them with 10 time a million times as much ammunition
(1:48:13) and power and you should instantly. If anything, if anything, most people I
(1:48:20) recommend you you try to become the plaintiff before they sue you. Even if if they threaten to sue you, you sue
(1:48:25) them first. If not, then you do a counter claim
(1:48:31) immediately. You go straight on the offensive. You're going straight at their throat. The moment you get the the
(1:48:37) the complaint, you're going straight at their throat. So, this is where the law
(1:48:43) librarians really helped me out because I thought that I would have to file a motion separately for counter claims,
(1:48:50) but they told me according to the procedures, I can actually include them in my response to the lawsuit. So, this
(1:48:57) is very convenient and it's the first document I filed, right? So, it is from the get-go. Perfect. Like you talked
(1:49:03) about and then that puts them in the hot seat. Yeah. So, I thought it might be helpful just to to list off the counter
(1:49:11) claims that I made because I think these are relevant even if you're if you're filing the suit, right? Because they
(1:49:19) they mess things up in a number of ways. Now, the first one was frivolous litigation because now that you can only
(1:49:26) file as a defendant, right? But basically I said that that they their
(1:49:31) their claim is based on evidence that's not factual because they say there is no
(1:49:38) payment when there is a payment. Right? So frivolous litigation and what that
(1:49:44) allows you to do is ask for damages um damages for your your fees. In other
(1:49:50) words, if you paid a lawyer or for your own time uh that you can get in that
(1:49:55) case as a defendant. Uh, and they, by the way, they asked for court costs um,
(1:50:02) in their initial complaint. So, they want to sue me and they want me to pay for the expense of suing me. So, I'm
(1:50:07) saying you sued me frivolously um, based on things that are not factual
(1:50:14) and so you actually have to pay my court costs. Now, the other three that I filed
(1:50:20) could be causes of action in your complaint um, as a plaintiff. And so obviously we've been talking a lot about
(1:50:26) breach of contract and the fraud that you mentioned is is part of that right
(1:50:31) because they misrepresented themsel fraudulently in in the contract and then
(1:50:37) they did not fulfill their obligations of accepting payment uh for the
(1:50:42) contract. Um then there's a breach of fiduciary duty because when you
(1:50:48) um negotiate or endorse a negotiable instrument um and then you deliver it to
(1:50:57) the responsible party, they have a fiduciary duty to you based on that
(1:51:02) instrument if you have a certain status on the instrument which is known as the holder or the holder in due course. So
(1:51:08) now this is where you have to learn uh some more about negotiable instruments but essentially they sent it to you for
(1:51:15) you to do something with and that makes you the holder or like kind of like the owner of that instrument and then when
(1:51:21) you send it to them and say here do this with the instrument you know and you've done it according to the law they have a
(1:51:29) duty to you to carry that out a fiduciary duty and if they don't do that they violate it. So and the beauty the
(1:51:36) beauty of what Dr. Dr. Coppin just said too, by the way, is that's the actual
(1:51:41) legal definition of the word payment. The actual legal definition of the word payment is performance.
(1:51:47) Payment and performance mean the same thing. So when they send you this paper, you're supposed to do something with the
(1:51:52) paper. You do something with the paper and you send it back. That that action of doing something with the paper and
(1:51:58) sending it back legally is defined as a payment. And it's actually legally
(1:52:04) defined as a payment for US dollars. And that's the part that no, like literally
(1:52:09) I've talked to massive private banking professionals and there's even a guy
(1:52:15) here who lives in my building who who is at Chase Bank over here and he even told me he's like, "Yeah, I've been hearing
(1:52:20) about some of this stuff. I didn't know you did this." Like I'm actually very curious in some of this stuff because it's just like we never taught any of
(1:52:26) this stuff in the banking. And I said, "Oh, come over, man. I'll teach you everything." I sent him some videos and stuff. So yeah, it's it's it's it's it
(1:52:35) all. So so so what banking is just just to clear this up because I think this is also really important to talk about just
(1:52:42) really really quick. Banking is a whole bunch a massive humongous cloud of
(1:52:50) completely unnecessary complexity that was developed on purpose so that no one would understand it. Okay. But in real
(1:52:57) honest to god truth, it's it's just a few pieces of information. Like that's it. It's l just
(1:53:04) they give you paper, you sign the paper in a certain way, you give it back and and that's it. You're done. Literally, like if you want to go to the ultimate
(1:53:10) simplicity as to how it really works. That's how it really works. Uh and and
(1:53:17) and you think, "Oh, it's all so complicated. Oh, it's also this." When you start to realize this whole thing,
(1:53:23) you start to go down this rabbit hole. You you see all this this this information like this, right? And then you start to dig and dig and dig and you
(1:53:29) just you're like, "Oh, this is junk. You throw this out. All this is junk, you throw this out. This is junk. Junk, junk, junk, junk, junk, junk, junk." And
(1:53:35) you wind up with just a bunch of dumpsters and all that's left is just like a few pieces of information. That's
(1:53:40) it. And that's the beauty of it because it's it's it's designed that way on purpose so that no one can understand it. That's
(1:53:46) the only defense they have. Yes. And they they of course, you know, create lots of uh terms that are
(1:53:54) redundant. And um the way that they write the language in the law is often,
(1:53:59) you know, they'll have, you know, several clauses um and then connecting a subject and a
(1:54:05) predicate, you know, with uh four commas in between, right? So it's tricky. You have to kind of learn the technique and
(1:54:12) you have to sit there always with the law dictionary. Um because even simple words like here, I'll give you one. You
(1:54:18) probably know this already, but the word at in a law dictionary means near. So
(1:54:24) like for example, attorney at law means an attorney near the law
(1:54:30) as opposed to like an attorney in fact, right? Which means that they are the
(1:54:35) fact attorney, right? Um so this is uh you know really important. You would
(1:54:41) easily miss something like that. And that's how we know that payment actually means performance. It doesn't mean
(1:54:47) handing Federal Reserve notes to someone and it doesn't mean handing gold to someone. Yeah. Right. It means
(1:54:53) performing. Yeah. So, so performance. So, so people think they have to go out
(1:54:59) and work to get Federal Reserve notes and then pay with Federal Reserve notes to discharge quote debt.
(1:55:06) But, but what we're learning and the the secondary option and the in my opinion preferable option is to simply perform.
(1:55:13) when you perform uh you don't need Federal Reserve notes and your debts are paid.
(1:55:19) The problem is that no one knows that. Even the bank doesn't know that. Well, that someone and that's the issue.
(1:55:26) Someone at the bank knows it. But this is this is where this movement is currently located. This currently this
(1:55:32) this movement is currently located at. We know how this all works. We've got it all down. We deliver what we need to do.
(1:55:38) We perform. But they say we haven't performed. They say it's not a payment. They say it's not US dollars and that
(1:55:45) and and you get on the phone with them and they think you're crazy. So what other options do we have? We have
(1:55:50) litigation. I mean look and I always tell everybody the same thing. If you have a better idea, I'm all ears because
(1:55:57) I don't know of anything better than than I don't know of any other option we have except litigation. Litigation is
(1:56:02) you are forced to sit down and have a conversation with me about how this really works. And if I prove that it
(1:56:08) really does work this way, which is very easy by the way, then you're going to now accept my performance that you
(1:56:13) didn't accept before, and you're going to pay me for wasting my time. That's what litigation is. And and that's by
(1:56:18) the way, all these things, right? You can simply in your interrogatory ask the
(1:56:23) other side, you know, what what is your definition of payment? Bro, I'll tell you I'll tell you I'll tell I'll tell
(1:56:30) you guys I'll tell the audience. Let's say there was a a a lawsuit for $50 million
(1:56:36) and I had to choose between the $50 million or just getting my questions answered.
(1:56:43) the $50 million, bro. You can keep it. I don't even want it. Don't even show it to me. It's like asking for a wish to have Bro, I want the questions
(1:56:51) answered. I'll pay. Keep You know what? Hookers and blow. Go take the 50
(1:56:56) million. Do whatever you want. Send me photos of how much fun you have with the 50 million. I want answers to these
(1:57:02) questions because answers to these questions are are are make the 50
(1:57:08) million look like a ham sandwich from Costco. Literally, that's how I think of
(1:57:13) this information because dude, if you if I find out how the Federal Reserve window works, who's this? Who's the
(1:57:19) person who who does the swab? Do they know how this works? I want to see the forms that are submitted. I want to see
(1:57:25) the endorsements that are submitted. Why are they submitted that way? Blah blah blah. You can literally print your own money forever. When you realize how this
(1:57:32) really works and you get down to the actual facts and you start to ask these kind of questions, it's infinite money for real. And it's infinite money from
(1:57:39) like three different sources. You can swap You can do credit card swap. You can do you got infinite money
(1:57:44) literally all around you. You can go on private jets. You can buy 10 private jets, 10 mansions. I could buy 15. I
(1:57:49) could buy the whole Hollywood Hills. All of it. So 50 million. I don't want 50
(1:57:55) million. Don't even That's disgusting. Don't even show that to me. I want the information because if you get the
(1:58:02) information, I'll drop the whole lawsuit, bro. You just give me the information, I'll drop everything. I'll
(1:58:07) cut you loose. I just want that info. I want it so freaking bad. So, that's kind of why like I love this idea. I love
(1:58:14) litigation because I'm I'm literally going to tell these people like, "You give me all this information and you
(1:58:20) hook me up and you and you show me how this works and you help me enter into this zone, I'll drop this lawsuit. You
(1:58:27) won't pay me a penny." And that's also very powerful. Do you see? You're right. And that's why we
(1:58:34) have to, you know, be able to exchange this kind of information about these suits, right? and and uh I mean and I
(1:58:40) I'm really hopeful that I don't have to have a non-disclosure, right? That's I want to get as much out on the table.
(1:58:47) Well, I've done a lot of research. They always always always always always
(1:58:53) make that part of the deal, right? But I can, you know, talk about everything up to that point as long as I don't give
(1:58:59) away identifying information and, you know, still be covered because, you know, we want to know what what's going
(1:59:05) to be effective, right? and and you know that if I know that oh you know well we settled it that means that I came out on
(1:59:13) top because yeah otherwise well here's well the the settlement the way settlement works just so you know from
(1:59:20) all the research I've done there's a couple things to say about this that I've never said because this is all like I'm learning all this right first and
(1:59:25) foremost the settlement is not really them admitting guilt to anything no absolutely not so it's kind of a weird
(1:59:32) complex thing where you're not saying like I won you kind of won but you kind of
(1:59:37) Uh, sort of. It's kind of a weird thing. You wouldn't say that they admitted guilt. I I would say that it it is a
(1:59:45) win, but it is obviously like that the other side is saving face, right?
(1:59:51) Because even if they might even be able to be victorious in the end, but it
(1:59:56) would cost them too much. Yes, that's true. Yeah. You you've too difficult of an adversary or the PR angle is too
(2:00:04) difficult, right? Yeah. Yeah. So, so it doesn't but it doesn't tell you what the law rules, right? Because they're
(2:00:12) conceding. So, all you can do is up to that point, right, you know, okay, were there any motions that were ruled upon?
(2:00:18) Uh was there evidence allowed to be admitted? Like what what happened right before they decided to settle? What did
(2:00:24) you did you do something? Because if you did, right, then that's that's the thing
(2:00:29) that made them settle, right? So I think we can still learn um quite a bit from
(2:00:36) the experience even if in the end right there's not a complete adjudication. And
(2:00:41) I think it's the I think the only time you'd end up going all the way to a verdict in a case like this is if you
(2:00:50) mess up in some big way. So either you're completely ignorant and you get made a fool of on a deposition or
(2:00:56) testimony. Yeah. or you submit arguments or documents that could be fraudulent or
(2:01:02) right like or if you try to use a sovereign citizen argument or talk about
(2:01:08) the straw man um you know that kind of stuff like anything you bring up you
(2:01:13) have to be able to prove right so I wouldn't go in there and say you know anything about the all caps name or my
(2:01:20) agency unless I can prove it uh so you know I would use just evidence I
(2:01:25) wouldn't um come up with some, you know, story about an or I wouldn't mention the
(2:01:31) Cesta KV Act of 1666. Yeah, that's this this is a this is a
(2:01:36) conversation that I've played in my head a million times because I'm always I'm moving in this direction. So I I project
(2:01:43) right and I think of myself in a courtroom. I you know many hours a day honestly and and the the truth is is
(2:01:48) that you know from my own research and my own my own idea and my own self-reflection it's sort of like
(2:01:55) uh you you it's a very simple conversation. It's it's if you admit
(2:02:01) that this thing on this piece of paper is is me as the human man, then that
(2:02:07) means that this is now a common law court and I have all the rights of of of
(2:02:13) a natural human uh uh of of a a real man. Is that where you want this to go?
(2:02:19) And they're going to say absolutely not. Okay, fine. So, we're actually in agreement that you know what I mean?
(2:02:25) Like like you can you can even pitch it in that direction. in the opposite direction where it's like, look, if you
(2:02:30) want to say that this is me, I'm actually cool with it because that means
(2:02:35) that I have all my human rights and we're going to go to an article 3 court and it means all these horrible things that are just going to absolutely
(2:02:41) decimate you in like 10 seconds. So, if you want to say that's me, I'm actually cool with it. You know what I mean? It
(2:02:47) actually benefits you and it benefits me to say that this thing is an inslegious.
(2:02:52) Uh which which the law obviously proved that out as well, but it's it's just kind of convoluted. But if you want to
(2:02:59) cut through all the convoluted just say, "Hey, look, if you want to say this is me, dude, I'm actually down." I
(2:03:05) actually don't have a disagreement with that because now now I reserve all my rights
(2:03:11) and now I'm a human and now you're really in trouble. You see the difference? So, so, so I don't think the
(2:03:18) the court would allow that because they would never allow that. They would never allow that because because they would
(2:03:23) lose jurisdiction like this. Boom. Jurisdiction's gone. They would also say that because the way you're talking
(2:03:30) about it, right, is that you'd be basically claiming ownership over the name, but they'll say that you you're
(2:03:35) not the owner. Exactly. That has been uh adjudicated uh in a courtroom before.
(2:03:40) But I'm just saying like like I'm not going to be the one on the defensive basically like like what I've realized
(2:03:47) in the past few weeks is I'm going to be on the offensive the whole time if you come after me. You're not the wrong the
(2:03:53) party who's wrong. That's what I mean though. That's what I mean though. It's like it's like it all comes down to
(2:03:59) what's in your head, right? So it's like you think I'm going to be on the defensive and be like I'm going to prove this and prove that. Like no. Look, you
(2:04:06) want to say that's me, bro. I'm all about it. You want to say that it's it's a conditional acceptance, too, which is what I teach in my courses. What it's,
(2:04:13) hey, look, you you think that's me. You want to say that's me. I'm actually down, bro. But this these are going to be this is going to be what's going to
(2:04:19) happen if you agree to that. And the judge is going to run in from center field and be like, no. But I'm
(2:04:24) just saying like if you between me and the prosecution or me and the defendant, like, hey, you want to say that? I'm
(2:04:29) actually down, bro. But I want you to know if you if we do that and that's what you think it is, it's blah blah
(2:04:34) blah blah blah all this stuff. like and I'm going sit there like this like, "Hey, you know what I mean? If you if that's
(2:04:41) what you think it is, like dude, let's go, bro. Let's go." You know what I mean? It all depends on on on many
(2:04:48) different in many different factors, too. But it's it's just
(2:04:53) there there's a c we we had this conversation over the phone where it's like there's a certain point where it's
(2:04:59) no longer about the information. It becomes a a spiritual, emotional,
(2:05:07) honorable, intentionbased battle
(2:05:13) where it's just like you have a bunch of facts, you have a bunch of facts, and it gets up to a
(2:05:18) certain point where it's just like who has more confidence, who knows what they're saying more, who has more passion, who has more devotion, who has
(2:05:24) more intention in what it is that they believe and they're saying. And there hits a certain point I believe that
(2:05:33) that's where the battle really occurs because because you and I can both agree
(2:05:38) and anyone who understands this information anywhere close to what we're talking about in this podcast that the
(2:05:44) facts are all horseshit. It's all horseshit. We're I mean I mean negotiable instruments and all this fin
(2:05:50) it's it's it's literally all just a joke. None of it even exists. All a joke. It's just a game. It's a a
(2:05:56) monopoly game. the very sophisticated one, right? Yeah. So, so, so for me there there it's like logic, logic,
(2:06:02) logic, logic, logic, logic. And then above that, it's just like, bro, like I will spiritually
(2:06:09) burn this whole city to the ground for what I know to believe to be true,
(2:06:18) just correct. And if you think you're going to stop me
(2:06:24) and you think you're going to sway me and you think I'm not going to get this done,
(2:06:29) you're delusional. It's never going to happen. You know, having this uh belief in yourself and
(2:06:36) confidence is vital because, you know, there going to be a lot of attempts,
(2:06:42) right, to get you to doubt yourself, to second guessess, um or to be to induce
(2:06:48) fear. Oh god. so common uh because oh you're going to you know owe debt, we're
(2:06:54) going to garnish your wages, lean your bank account, put you in debtor's prison, all these kind of things. So you
(2:07:00) you have to be confident um in in the you know in your opinion of the
(2:07:06) information such that you are emotionally grounded. Yes. Right. And have this composure because and you are
(2:07:13) in the right. Right. And I and I have to actively remind myself of this thing because when I do, you know, check the
(2:07:20) mailbox, right? And I see there's another uh, you know, letter or
(2:07:25) threatening foreclosure or you know, some other thing like that, right? It's
(2:07:31) like, well, gosh, you could. But then then I go back and sit in my house and I realize everything is just fine. And uh
(2:07:39) this is all just part of the game of sending paper around and eventually
(2:07:44) we'll you know justice will uh come to be right and then you know they won't
(2:07:51) send me threatening paper anymore. They'll just send me the regular paper
(2:07:56) right so you have to be kind of in that state of mind in order to go through
(2:08:02) this. Right? So, if you're afraid of your own shadow, then this is this is not uh the right um path uh for you to
(2:08:12) go right now perhaps. Well, I was terrified for a long time. I was terrified for a long time. I mean, all
(2:08:18) those letters and all that stuff. I mean, it just scared the out of me. Uh but I just I just
(2:08:26) I just said, you know, I I know this is right. I know this is true and I just have to
(2:08:32) I don't know just keep going. I you know and and once you get through that first
(2:08:39) run especially like the first time you do any of this stuff you know you come out the other end and then it's just like way easier the next time
(2:08:46) and then it's way easier the next time and it's just like it's just like anything else. It's like hitting on girls at a bar. It's just like getting a
(2:08:53) new job or going getting job interview. It's just like moving to a new city. It's all the same It's just life. We're talking about life here. We're not
(2:08:59) talking about some crazy esoteric totally everyone listening to this has
(2:09:05) experienced what we're talking about. It's just that it's it's in a new zone. It's a new area, but it's relative to
(2:09:12) everything you've ever experienced in your entire life. It's the same It really is.
(2:09:19) That's right. You can always, you know, lose things, right? Everything you do that's worthwhile is taking a risk. You
(2:09:25) drive your car. you you could run into a moose and uh you know lose your life at
(2:09:31) any time, right? And this you know you you might uh you might lose possessions,
(2:09:36) you might have uh you know re repo men uh following you around um whatever. But
(2:09:43) any material object can always be replaced, right? And uh in the end,
(2:09:48) right, we will be able to enjoy the full benefits that we're supposed to uh if
(2:09:55) we, you know, keep focused um on the truth and um you know, don't give in to
(2:10:01) that kind of fear and intimidation. So Brandon, I feel like we've been going
(2:10:07) for a couple hours and um we we've covered quite a lot of ground, right?
(2:10:12) Yeah. This is this is going to be cool for my audience because this that we're talking about a lot of things in this
(2:10:17) show that I haven't really talked about yet because I'm a little careful in what
(2:10:23) I talk about. I try to get into it, study it for a long time,
(2:10:28) at least kind of dip my fingers into it, and then I kind of start talking about it. Um there's a huge delay between when
(2:10:36) I start researching something and when I start talking about it. Um, and and a lot of this is stuff that everyone's
(2:10:42) asking me all the time that I just refuse to talk about up until pretty much this point. Uh, I think a lot of it
(2:10:47) comes down to how impressive your documentation is. Uh, to be honest with you, it's it's it's a
(2:10:55) I can tell you've really put a lot of effort and time and and into this and it's just really um it's really
(2:11:01) impressive. like to the point where I would I would go so far as to say, you know, anybody that that thinks that I'm some kind of professional in this area,
(2:11:08) I would say that I would I would consider you like my equal, honestly. truly uh in a lot of ways cuz the the
(2:11:14) the documentation and how much you've you've you've spent on this and how far
(2:11:19) you've you've gone down the rabbit hole on this and how much you've uh if if anything else that you teach and
(2:11:26) anything else that you talk about uh involving natural health or anything else is anywhere close to as well
(2:11:33) researched and documented as what I've seen you do with this. Uh it's very impressive. Very very impressive. Well,
(2:11:40) you know, listen what I when I'm passionate about someone um something uh
(2:11:45) I you know can't I get obsessed almost um because I just want to learn. and I
(2:11:52) I'm thirsty for knowledge and understanding and it's just something that's driven me in my life and
(2:11:58) especially when it could result in some form of achievement of justice and this
(2:12:04) is really right in that area as is healthcare right so they've both been
(2:12:09) things that I've been passionate about and and yes you're right I just dive in like you do um you know read and listen
(2:12:17) to everything I can find and then once I got that threshold of confidence, I
(2:12:23) started actually doing these things and and yeah, I didn't really have success
(2:12:30) uh yet fully, right? Some minor successes, but I still persist because I
(2:12:35) know, right, um that that this is really the way things work. I just don't have
(2:12:41) quite all the answers because of that complexity that's put in here. I I
(2:12:46) believe purposely to make it really really difficult. Oh, God. Yes. for you to, you know, fully realize um, you
(2:12:53) know, your capabilities, uh, and, um, how you're supposed to engage, uh, with
(2:12:59) this system. So, you know, I'm very honored by your compliments. Um, and,
(2:13:05) uh, but we'll see, you know, what what does the other side think of what I've written? What is the judge going to think of it when a judge gets assigned?
(2:13:12) And, you know, that will be the real test. And um you know I will be sharing
(2:13:19) at least parts of these documents um to help other people see you know how I
(2:13:24) write the reasoning um uh related to some of these things. Uh and it's really quite simple. I mean I I just make sure
(2:13:34) everything's included. But uh you know I find the law source and I look up um
(2:13:39) what it takes to make that argument and then I I just put in some basic elements
(2:13:46) um you know to refer to that and um you know I I'm lucky because my experience
(2:13:52) in the past involved being an expert witness and yes writing documents for the court and reading uh court documents
(2:13:59) and so that gave me you know to sit down and write a legal document. And I I have
(2:14:05) experience with that already, even if I haven't litigated. So, but it it's definitely it, you know, I'm at creative
(2:14:12) writing or writing something that's engaging to readers. I'm terrible at, right? I can write scientific writing,
(2:14:19) legal writing, like stuff that's cut and dry, analytical. Um, so, you know, um,
(2:14:25) in a way I feel always feel like my writing is, um, could be a lot better.
(2:14:30) But this is not fancy writing, right? This is this is basically write it clear, make a clear argument, you know,
(2:14:37) use logic, right? Uh set up the thing, you know, first A happened, then B
(2:14:43) happened, A plus B equals C. You know, that's all you have to do in it's a little depressing in that way. Yeah,
(2:14:49) it's it's it is very because I'm the opposite, I guess, of you. I'm I'm more of I'm
(2:14:56) almost like a I'd almost go so far as to say I'm more like a woman. I want to I want to get into all the feelings. I
(2:15:02) want you to I want you to cry and laugh. See, that's why you're going to be great, you know, at a trial because you
(2:15:09) get up there, you do that for your opening statement, right? And then you you'll engage them. Um, and that'll be
(2:15:15) very uh very useful. But but I can see in in general in general action this is
(2:15:23) definitely more of a male demographic area up until trial and then I would say
(2:15:30) yeah it becomes more of a a a 5050 or maybe even like a
(2:15:36) 6040 on the female end of the spectrum. But um there are women who have taken
(2:15:42) this quite far. In fact, um I studied with uh a woman to learn equity process,
(2:15:49) uh Rebecca Rodriguez, and we we have a uh done a discussion like this as well.
(2:15:54) Um so, you know, this isn't a barrier, uh certainly for anyone, but it you do
(2:16:01) have to draw on your masculine energy because, you know, the a legal matter is
(2:16:07) adversarial by definition. Yes. Right. So, you're now you you know, it's literally war. Yes. So, so you have to
(2:16:15) be prepared to, you know, engage in that um and not ingratiate yourself. But, you
(2:16:21) know, there's advantages also to being a woman in this uh arena as well because
(2:16:27) you may be able to, you know, weaken a man just through your No, very true. So
(2:16:32) true. So, um I you know, it's approachable anyone of of either gender,
(2:16:37) right? Of either of the two genders. Uh can certainly What about Zar Zims? Huh?
(2:16:48) Would you look at look at his reaction here?
(2:16:53) No zer allowed.
(2:17:00) Get the levity in there a little bit. You know what I mean? You've got to have a little fun in this material.
(2:17:06) [Laughter] Zurims don't have any rights, which is very sad. It's it's all just a big ploy.
(2:17:12) You know, it's the it's the the they them and the zerims. You're not a you're not a man or a woman anymore if you're
(2:17:17) one of those things. So, you don't have any rights. So, it's it the whole thing is a campaign to strip you of your rights. And I like to I like to
(2:17:24) communicate it as that because what it does is it sort of it it it doesn't really make those individuals who may
(2:17:30) think that way wrong necessarily. It just it just it's it's a it's an it's a it's a warning. I give it as a warning.
(2:17:36) It's full it's full disclosure. They deserve full disclosure. And the full disclosure is if you want to do that,
(2:17:42) you are you are relinquishing your rights as a man or a woman. And if you want to continue down that path, you
(2:17:49) deserve to know that. And if you want to do that after fully realizing that of
(2:17:55) what you were about to do, that's your choice.
(2:18:00) That's kind of how I pitch it. Uh because otherwise you end up getting deplatformed or whatever. Not I don't I
(2:18:06) don't pitch it specifically to not get deplatformed. That's really how I think of it.
(2:18:15) Yeah. Well, many of you know the sort of uh cultural arguments uh let's say that
(2:18:21) are put forth that would seem to create you know more fairness
(2:18:27) uh more people getting along with each other and such. Right. and they sound
(2:18:32) really good and the language that they use makes it very attractive, right? That we can uh all love each other and
(2:18:38) live super happy and free lives. But those things in actuality are the exact
(2:18:45) opposite of that. They are kind of that's the way that they sell it to us.
(2:18:51) Um but if you look beneath the surface at the actual policies, at the actual
(2:18:56) laws, you'll see that it's bringing about um everything but uh those
(2:19:02) desirable characteristics. And the truth is is that if we want to have harmony
(2:19:08) and tolerance and acceptance and uh you know teamwork and collaboration and
(2:19:15) solidarity, we have to each work personally on those things ourselves. uh
(2:19:20) those are you know we can't force everyone to uh behave the way that we
(2:19:26) would like them to behave. um you know, of course, we have to kind of not allow
(2:19:32) them to infringe upon our rights directly, right? That so we have to have some kind of uh rule of law. But really,
(2:19:40) if we want to make a great nation, a great world, a great home, um
(2:19:47) a great congregation, a great friendship, a great community, it's always up to the members of those
(2:19:54) entities through their own action and effort. That's the only way to create
(2:20:00) those things and to relate with each other in those godly ways. Yeah. Yeah.
(2:20:07) And it's so it's so interesting because even a lot of these groups and a lot of these things that you're seeing pop up now, uh what a lot of people don't
(2:20:15) realize is under 50USC section 842, it actually states that uh anyone who is
(2:20:22) a a who prescribes to or is a successor to or a subsidiary organization to the
(2:20:28) Communist Party basically does not have any rights in America. So you also have to realize too is that
(2:20:35) there's a lot of trickery that's tricking people especially young people into joining communist related
(2:20:42) activities we shall say. And again it's all about
(2:20:47) deterioration of rights because the zerims and the they them and all that they're they've just burned all their
(2:20:53) rights in a trash can. And all the communist people who get tricked into communistic behaviors or communistic
(2:20:59) groups, they've just burned all their rights straight in the dumpster, straight out of the United States code. So, it's one of those things where
(2:21:08) it's a it's a weird world we live in where there's a lot of trickery trying to get you to believe as though you are
(2:21:13) doing something beautiful when in fact you are destroying yourself. And then
(2:21:19) what happens is the the mind as you know has a tendency to to defend that of
(2:21:24) which someone has decided upon and and the more a person has invested in that of which they have decided upon the
(2:21:31) larger the fortress is that will defend those particular. So the way that the whole system is built in these communist
(2:21:37) factions is they get a person to join or or perform in sort of some some sort of
(2:21:44) communist faction and then they the they have them contribute and contribute and
(2:21:49) contribute and contribute and the more they contribute then the more invested they are the more invested they are then
(2:21:54) the more willing they are to defend that of which they have been invested in. So what it is is it's very sad because then
(2:22:01) you have someone who who joins something that appears on the surface to be very very good and very very wonderful and
(2:22:07) then six months later now they've they've entirely encased themselves inside of this thing of which they will
(2:22:12) almost die for and they they can't get out because they they don't understand that their their own mind they've let it
(2:22:19) in and then now they defended it and then now they're they're a prisoner of it and that's the very very depressing.
(2:22:25) I I don't I try not to do too much direct
(2:22:31) uh uh uh deg degradation to toward those people because I feel like I have a
(2:22:36) little bit of empathy toward that situation myself. Not not that I excuse the behavior necessarily. Uh but but
(2:22:44) it's it's it's it's understand your enemy. That's what the Sunzu law number one. Know thy enemy. Uh
(2:22:52) and and that's kind of the entire basis of my entire platform. Uh and I try so hard to to to do that. You know, you
(2:23:00) know, there were such sophisticated um methods of mass, you know, manipulation,
(2:23:06) right? The whole public relations industry was sort of founded upon that.
(2:23:11) We have, you know, uh psychologists talking about this things like mass formation, right? which is kind of what
(2:23:17) you just described how it can happen on a large scale and you know identity
(2:23:22) politics is another way to that right so we're you know for us to take on this
(2:23:28) like we we've had to first overcome all of that and realize you know that that
(2:23:34) that all is not really what's going on that's not the real truth and uh Brandon
(2:23:39) I want to wrap it up but uh you know yeah sure totally we could probably talk all night huh where uh where's
(2:23:45) you know, tell people where to find you again. And definitely, if you haven't already, uh, sign up for his contract
(2:23:52) killer course. Uh, that's the core material. You'll get to know, uh, Brandon and, um, be introduced to all
(2:23:59) these topics and it's a great springboard uh, for further study and to head towards litigation, right, which we
(2:24:05) talked about tonight. So, like I said, it's a it's a be with us and butad slash uh uh Jerry Springer show, but uh you
(2:24:13) know the the clean version is don't be a slave.com or you can go to brandonjo williams.com, but it will redirect you
(2:24:20) to put your main web address in the show notes below. And I I appreciate you not
(2:24:26) using such colorful language here, but So, let me say it. It's onesttofuck.com.
(2:24:33) All right, there you go. I've now I'm no longer a virgin. Perfect. So, uh yeah,
(2:24:40) it's worth checking out and and the website has extensive uh resources including, you know, all the statutes
(2:24:47) that we mentioned tonight, I guarantee are listed there uh in reference and uh the language of many of them is there uh
(2:24:55) as well. So, it it's a great uh resource uh that you should not pass up. And
(2:25:00) everything is 100% free. Um unless you want to buy some pickle uh
(2:25:06) paraphernalia. That is so true. That is so true.
(2:25:13) All right. Thank you. I appreciate this so much. I uh I would love to get a copy of this for my audience. This has been
(2:25:19) fantastic. It's definitely a one of the one of the most advanced
(2:25:25) discussions I've ever had, if not literally the most advanced discussion I've ever had. So, thank you very much.
(2:25:30) Good. I'm looking forward to the comments. All right, you take care everyone. We'll see you next time.
