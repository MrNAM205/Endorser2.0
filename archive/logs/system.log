2025-09-15 20:11:57,935 - SystemLogger - INFO - Narrator: Summary generated. It reads: now they've been publishing
(3:10:59) in the news just in the last year you're hearing about all these cops that are coming up with cancer from all kind of various things well this is why folks
(3:11:05) because they're being bombarded by these high energy radar guns if I was a policeman I wouldn't turn that thing on for nothing I'd cut the wire or anything
(3:11:12) I'm not turning it on what do you think of that all right take it out looking at a speedometer and I'll see how fast the guy is going if he's going fast I'll
(3:11:18) give him a ticket but I'm not turning that thing up just so I can have my hair fall out get a get
(3:11:24) a chemotherapy treatment I don't need that kind of stuff you understand
(3:11:30) I told the judge I says you've got any kind of idea what kind of power is coming off the end of the antenna on that gun I said for every inch that it
(3:11:37) goes past the windshield the power curve is squaring itself now it's reaching out
(3:11:42) a quarter of a mile you got any kind of idea how much power is coming off the end of that antenna
(3:11:47) I said that poor guy is being bombarded with high energy microwave energy I don't think it's right
(3:11:54) so anyway it got dismissed in uh psychological warfare worked in most of the cops in my area don't even have that
(3:12:00) thing on anymore because I notice when you go by in my radar detector doesn't even go off so I know that it's effective now that's psychological
(3:12:06) warfare It's a combination of honesty and basically I do care about the police officers I don't want them to be
(3:12:12) endangered they're good police officers out there they have a right to work and have a safe job just like anybody else
(3:12:17) anymore and I was upset with them when they dumped agent orange on us when we were in Vietnam I mean it's so logical okay now the
(3:12:25) bottom line is a lot of things are going on out here and you have to be cognizant of what's going on and you have to be
(3:12:30) cognizant of your rights and you have to be willing to take the necessary and appropriate action then you can have
(3:12:36) some fun at it I I like uh an elder gentleman who's one of my
(3:12:42) mentors used to small and he says uh if you're not having fun you're not doing
(3:12:48) it right he says I'll submit a brief and then he'll send it back to me and he'll tell me all the things that are wrong with it
(3:12:54) and I'll fix it and I'll send it right back to him and I'll add a few more things in there and he'll get all mad that I fixed it and then I'll then he'll
(3:13:00) send me back a thing telling me he doesn't agree with it and I'll send him back an answer telling me that's too bad because that's the law
(3:13:08) now you can have a lot of fun doing this another neat thing you can do is go down and sit in courts I highly recommend
(3:13:14) ladies or gentlemen that don't have anything to do for an afternoon retirees especially get your Best gal or your
(3:13:19) best to uh girlfriend or boyfriend whatever it is take two of you two safety and
(3:13:25) numbers take two of you dress in your best suit and what have you tie or best of the skirt and one hand you go down and sit
(3:13:32) in court and take a legal pad is tulian set there for the day and the left you want to sit in the left rear side the
(3:13:37) last few in the left rear side and just sit there and do not smile
(3:13:43) they'll think you're from the judicial tenure Commission you ought to see what happens it's great
(3:13:49) everybody gets read their rights everybody gets treated like a human creature it's absolutely uh
(3:13:58) the judge will stop what he's doing and ask you we're not here for anything serious today are we and I'll say no sir
(3:14:04) you're right I'm just casually observing [Music]
(3:14:09) why are we here today all right sir we were just in the area we heard that you were a real good judge
(3:14:15) and we wanted to see you in action my associate was driving in the area and we stopped by to see him he says that fish
(3:14:21) smells awful Loosely wrapped to me now you tell me why you're here right
(3:14:27) now honest to God sir we're just casually observing okay all lawyers in my Chambers shut the court down goes in
(3:14:33) his Chambers now look they start trying cases in the chambers and they started trying them in
(3:14:39) the hallway and they were in around the side of the clerk's office at the other in the hallway then they come back and then the little gal from the prosecutor
(3:14:45) goes on she says what's with the Nerd Patrol the judge give her a look that would kill
(3:14:51) don't you do it today honey you keep that mouth zipped these guys
(3:14:56) are from the tenure Commission we don't want no problems with the state you
(3:15:02) button that hitch I mean you can have a lot of fun my
(3:15:07) associate was just absolutely almost in tears he could keep her stay faced in the water so I said sorry we're leaving
(3:15:13) we got out all the way down Rochester Road to the
(3:15:19) expressway so that's the most fun I had in my life just sitting there in that day and
(3:15:24) everybody was getting off guys were getting sentences canceled guys are getting out of jail one guy at twenty five hundred dollars
(3:15:31) with the fines and they got reduced to 120 24 and five days serve
(3:15:36) it was 240 dollars and it was going to be 10 days in jail but the judge turned to me and when kisses I can't throw them
(3:15:41) in jail for a civil interaction doing that
(3:15:46) so this is the last offer I'm going to give young man it's going to be 124 and five day serves that sound good to you
(3:15:53) the lawyer turns to me says you better take this is the best deal you're ever gonna get
(3:15:58) so I'm telling you you can be effective as Citizens you sound off tell them hey this man
(3:16:04) I heard we got American flag on a pole out there last time I heard we got a constitution and by God we're going to keep it
(3:16:10) forever forever anybody got a problem with that okay now there's a bunch of other things
(3:16:16) we're going to take just a little break here and we're going to come back and we're going to finish off with some really hard stuff for the advanced
(3:16:21) student I always take all my lucky charms with me and I was one of the fellas that served with the infamous
(3:16:27) Apache troop first squad or ninth year cavalry uh we were the fellas that were in the
(3:16:33) movie Apocalypse Now where they told you I love the smell of napalm in the morning and that gentleman was exactly
(3:16:39) was exactly like that huh this book is done about the
(3:16:47) Cobra Gunship pilot by the name of Jerome Boyle who we used to call uh beardy Harry because he looked just like
(3:16:54) uh Dirty Harry make my day he used to have that painted
(3:17:00) on the side of his aircraft along with Pinball Wizard and a few other things uh
(3:17:05) this is a phenomenal book about a story of uh serious Americans This is a cobra
(3:17:11) pilot Jerry Boyle's Own Story a former policeman arrived in Vietnam in March of 70 he went from being a FNG which I
(3:17:18) can't tell you what that is in a church but it's bad to a combat vet in just two months whether rescuing down Crews
(3:17:24) flying fiery combat missions during the invasion of Cambodia being shot down himself while saw War quickly turned
(3:17:29) from a scary game of bullets rockets and grenades to a terrifying race against death we're just split seconds could
(3:17:36) turn a scene of breathtaking Beauty into one of Stark absolute Terror he witnessed men risked their lives daily
(3:17:42) to save others and he heard the dreaded call taking fire taking fire that were too often a fellow Pilot's
(3:17:49) very last words before his chapter became an inferno well I learned real fast that there weren't a lot of going
(3:17:54) home parties for Apache troops Pilots and when you listen to some of the stuff
(3:18:00) this is a cobra Pilot's life and death experiences in Vietnam's legendary Apache troop first of the ninth air
(3:18:06) cavalry this pilot is the recipient of uh he was a California Native and former police
(3:18:12) interventor of California among the medals and decorations awarded aim for his service and this was kind of typical of most of the people in this outfit
(3:18:20) Silver Star three distinguished flying crosses five round Stars two Army Commendation metal surveiller he now
(3:18:26) works as a pilot who flies in the sport of offshore operations he lives in Andrea he lives in Ohio California with
(3:18:33) his wife Andrea of 20 years and to read some of the stuff about this is absolutely
(3:18:39) phenomenal some of the things that get involved I'll just read you the a closing part of this thing
(3:18:48) to give you an idea the Apache troop I served in wasn't part
(3:18:54) of the army the Army was part of Apache troop we were Mavericks but the kind of team that any commander with hair on his
(3:19:01) tailpipe would want his unit to be late if you couldn't get what you needed to
(3:19:06) accomplish the mission through normal channels we big borrowed or stole it usually the ladder
(3:19:11) with few exceptions I'd follow the men of Apache troop into hell no one full well sooner or later someone from the
(3:19:18) blues the whites the Reds to lift the tune of the Miss section would emerge from a smoking hole dragging a dead
(3:19:23) smoldering ass of the devil hydrates a little bit but I can tell you
(3:19:29) that these men were phenomenal phenomenal Fighters and it was my great privilege
(3:19:34) to serve with them and when I go to court I take oh of my battle stuff my my Ranger stuff my
(3:19:41) first year cab this is from the Apache troop logo there's my flight Wing the extra ones I wore this is the first of
(3:19:48) the ninth logo that was put on the nose of all the aircraft there's the first there's first 75th

(3:20:05) Constitution it's a silver coin that's given as a serious Defender group
(3:20:13) Memento this is MacArthur and it's solid silver then I got all my Ranger jump stuff I
(3:20:20) put that on there I take my strike like lightning sound like thunder
(3:20:26) all my Ranger stuff that when I was in the Rangers and I take my first year Cavalry when I
(3:20:33) was in Cambodia because I was with these boys on Cambodian locked in my Apache troop
(3:20:40) that's right off of our shoulder Patches from the Apache troop the original one I was with the take my Detroit Judo Club
(3:20:48) this is a patch they give you if you're running 50 miles to save your life you've got a certain time to do it in they give you a boot lace and a pocket
(3:20:55) knife and if you get caught they put you in A POW Camp and treat you like a prisoner so it's like you got 12 hours to run 50
(3:21:02) miles or you go to the pow compound and they treat you like uh
(3:21:08) a pow they hung my buddy up in a pit full of poisonous snakes upside down for about a day or two
(3:21:15) and then this is my other patches that I wear from from Vietnam and
(3:21:21) Special Operations group I flew in support of Vogue rights and Cambodia we used to deliver their supplies I got my
(3:21:27) my Ranger belt buckle all these are momentos of it program my bronze star medal my I have

(3:21:46) feathers this is the sog Special Operations group macv that we flew in support of uh
(3:21:54) Vogue rights and Cambodia and the Cambodian operation I was one of the special air Crews that was selected
(3:22:00) personally to fly the infamous marine sniper and allow us to shoot that General at 800
(3:22:06) yards I was one of the guys that flew him in and we wear the wings of eagles
(3:22:14) we support the National Rifle Association totally
(3:22:19) you know we ain't fooling around we want our constitution we want our Second Amendment I am a member of Vietnam
(3:22:24) veterans and basically when I go to court I put all my Lucky Charms in my pocket it kind
(3:22:31) of drives them nuts down at the courthouse I also have my flag I always take my flag with me
(3:22:38) and I have my Vietnam veterans belt buckles and my uh the oppresso Libre which means the
(3:22:45) Liberator of an oppression from the special forces that was given to me by the boys over there and for
(3:22:52) helping them you know so all this goes in my my pockets and I
(3:22:58) go to court my lucky charm I call them and it it's a little heavy but I you
(3:23:06) know it's like when I go I go for memory of those fine soldiers and some of the things they add
(3:23:12) rather be killing communists one of the models of the paratroopers from the charity company Ranger company
(3:23:19) Rangers was the boys that supported that parachute that uh that marine sniper that shot him with
(3:23:25) shot that General at 800 yards so I'm a soldier soldier I've been a soldier soldier I believe in the things
(3:23:31) that the soldiers have done I've seen a lot of good soldiers pay the maximum price
(3:23:37) um I personally killed him in my arms and I listened to their last words tell my mother tell my wife tell my family I
(3:23:44) love them and to me the Constitution is a very serious factor and we defend it
(3:23:53) to the death and do not fool around when it comes to the Constitution I've been doing it for 25 years I am a graduate of
(3:24:00) Project Blue Book the special project
(3:24:06) I also take my harmonica I am harmonica Project Blue Book is where they pull
(3:24:13) their soldiers aside and taught you the Constitution and I always take my harmonic and I give
(3:24:18) them hell
(3:24:30) we give it to him
(3:24:36) yeah well we uh we were flying interdiction along the Cambodian border
(3:24:42) and we come up on the door these uh b-model Huey it was a smaller Huey and
(3:24:47) it was uh painted blue and silver and uh all along the side of the tail
(3:24:54) boom was white uh powder no I informed the aircraft commander and he told me
(3:25:01) he was healing them on the hailing frequency and he called him up and told them the land we wanted to inspect their cargo and they told us basically to
(3:25:08) blank off and die you know who we are my pilot told him he didn't care if he
(3:25:13) was a man from glad he was going to land an aircraft we were going to inspect this cargo basically he told us uh
(3:25:22) we're not Landing my pilot ordered me to roll my guns up and he shot him down we went down there and we blew his landing
(3:25:29) gear off shot it below his fuel cell and he got the idea we weren't fooling around he went down and landed in the
(3:25:35) rice paddy and we inspected his cargo and sure enough he was carrying heroin so the pilot gave him a choice he could
(3:25:41) go to Long been jail with us for Contraband trafficking or he could uh hitchhike home baby
(3:25:47) so he chose the hitchhike home and figured he had a chance of course we knew that was going to be rather
(3:25:53) difficult in Cambodia him being three foot tall or anything they were walking and a white man on top of that
(3:25:59) but uh we gave him a chance and the bottom line is he didn't want to go to jail so
(3:26:05) we torched his aircraft and uh we got back in the CEO uh are you crazy and
(3:26:12) those people are CIA they're gonna kill you I told him make my day I said uh
(3:26:17) they were trafficking in that dope to rgis and uh God knows who else and as far as I'm concerned we stuck a tomb for
(3:26:23) about 15 million and I'm just tickling if I could do it again tomorrow I'd do it again
(3:26:28) and that's a true story we actually did it so anyway to make a long story short I'm a
(3:26:34) serious Soldier I love my country and its Constitution and I do not compromise when it comes to Constitution
(3:26:40) I descend to the death that's what we do anybody who knows about great sees the most decorated soldier in the history of
(3:26:47) the United States he's a very congenial gentleman he uh when we worked for them in
(3:26:52) Cambodia he was all business all business and uh we flew his fifth Special Forces people all over for
(3:26:59) whatever Recon missions they had and um they they got to work with us and
(3:27:05) they know we were pretty serious folks and uh I personally think uh Bob writes is going to be painted as some Desperado
(3:27:12) no matter what he does only because he is uh is uh associated with the avant-garde
(3:27:18) type uh constitutional defense he was the guy that got the Ruby uh
(3:27:25) Ridge Manor resolved peacefully um clearly he went in to save Randy Weaver
(3:27:33) because Randy Weaver used to be one of his boys on the team
(3:27:39) asked in his own life because it goes to him too so he's a man of great courage I respect
(3:27:46) uh what he's doing I appreciate that he's trying to make things happen but I also
(3:27:51) know that he's going to be held in some type of villainous to no matter what he does people are going to not understand
(3:27:57) and they're going to be afraid and of course the newspapers will continue to paint him as uh whatever Boogeyman in
(3:28:02) the closet they can all right we're gonna go on with our programming here we just got a little
(3:28:08) off the track there just a little bit just to kind of let you give an idea where we're coming from actually uh we take a pretty serious
(3:28:16) attack on the Constitution and we want to get into some other issues we want to
(3:28:21) get into uh things like things like money money money money money money money and one of the best
(3:28:28) tips you can get it's from a gentleman uh we call him
(3:28:33) Ernie uh he uh basically is known throughout the
(3:28:38) movement around here he delivers all the tapes and what have you and he has a tape called
(3:28:45) wake up America and basically it starts telling you how money works and why it works and what
(3:28:52) they're doing with our money and when you're done
(3:28:57) you really understand what's going on but we want to share some things with you about the money we got a good story
(3:29:02) to tell you too but basically we want to share with you right now in Michigan the Michigan
(3:29:08) compile laws 21.153 Michigan compile laws act
(3:29:13) obligations do state or municipality and date operative when paid by check or
(3:29:18) legal tender whenever any check or Bank draft shall be tendered for the payment of any debt
(3:29:24) taxes or other obligation do the state or to any municipality they're in such
(3:29:31) check draft shall operate as a payment made on the date the check or draft was
(3:29:37) received and accepted by the receiving officer if it shall be paid on the presentation without deduction for
(3:29:44) exchange or cost of collection all agencies of the state of Michigan shall request that checks tendered in
(3:29:51) payment of an obligation due the state shall be made payable to
(3:29:56) the state of Michigan no receiving officer shall be required to receive in
(3:30:01) payment of any debt taxes or other obligation collectible or receivable by him any tender
(3:30:08) other than gold or silver coin of the United States the United States Treasury notes which you can't get today
(3:30:14) gold certificates which you can't get today's silver certificates which you can't get today or other Federal Reserve
(3:30:20) Bank notes and there's no banknotes in circulation there's Federal Reserve notes but there's no federal reserve banknotes
(3:30:26) now the reality is by this fact you are specifically precluded from tendering
(3:30:32) lawfully without being a party to a felony that of the basement of the coin of the realm against the 1792 coinage
(3:30:37) act the Sherman coinage egg so Roger Sherman wrote a book about this and
(3:30:43) it tells you all about coinage in the debasement of the coin of the realm and that's why he is affiliated with the
(3:30:48) 1792 coinage act now the reality to this is what has been going on over a period of
(3:30:54) time is they've been playing games with the money as we can see right here
(3:30:59) we have right here a silver certificate this certifies that there is on deposit
(3:31:04) in the treasury of the United States one dollar right of silver all right
(3:31:11) one dollar in silver payable to the bearer on demand now we had a little
(3:31:17) time we got together we had some of these notes we had some gold certificate notes also we got one here that says uh
(3:31:25) [Music] we got one here that says uh United States note the United States of America
(3:31:31) now notice the difference here folks this one just says this node is legal
(3:31:36) tender for all debts public and private but we know that that's a lie because Article 1 Section 10 of the Constitution
(3:31:41) says nothing but gold and silver coins shall be made a tender in payment of debt now this is going to bring up a real
(3:31:48) interesting case that we got here now we went down to the Federal Reserve Bank and we took 500 worth of uh these
(3:31:56) are silver certificates here but we took gold certificates 20 gold pieces we had five hundred dollars Rick and we went in
(3:32:02) this Federal Reserve Bank and I walked up to the window and I said I'm the bearer on demand and lawful money of
(3:32:07) accounting the United States Government Center I said I said I want my gold I handed her the notes she looked at me
(3:32:13) and she said sir we don't have any gold I said are you trying to tell me this bank is overextended everybody looks you can't come in here
(3:32:21) and do that sir you're gonna get a run out of band guys some I'm asking you for my gold I'm the bearer I'm hearing
(3:32:27) before you demanding it says painted the barrier on demanding off money in the county United States government 20 is
(3:32:32) gold I got 500 worth of these and I'll take 20 gold pieces we don't have any gold
(3:32:39) are you trying to tell me this bank is overextended
(3:32:45) this Lieutenant comes running up and all these guys got rifles in here all the poor arms
(3:32:50) then the lieutenant walks up to me says all right what the hell is going on here so I explained to him I said sir I am
(3:32:55) the bearer on demand and lawful money of the county United States government I'm here and before this bank this is a
(3:33:00) waffle Bank of the government and I'm asking you I'm asking them to pay me the
(3:33:06) bear on demand my twenty dollars in gold for every one of these 20 gold demand deposit the notes that I have and I have
(3:33:13) up to 500 worth and I just asked you for the gold she told me she doesn't have any gold I tried to tell her you tell me the Spanx over extended she told me you
(3:33:19) can't come in here and do that and the next thing you know you show up the lieutenant looked at me so once you
(3:33:24) get the guys gold come on guys we're out of here so they
(3:33:30) left they couldn't give me my gold because
(3:33:36) they ain't got any gold but there is a contract on here that says pay to the bear on demand
(3:33:42) now on this one it's a dollar silver in theory the contract is there and you could in
(3:33:48) theory go collect it but if I'm trying to collect it there is no gold there is no silver they
(3:33:54) don't have any now over a period a long period of time in barter we have slowly
(3:33:59) been pushed into a position of of impossibility to perform
(3:34:05) now if you walk in and check your hat and
(3:34:11) get a hat check and then when you come back to get your hat back
(3:34:16) they hand you another hand check can you wear the hat check obviously not so obviously the note
(3:34:24) is not the dollar all it is is the promise to pay a dollar
(3:34:30) does everybody understand that and what has happened over a long period of time in customer uses is the people have been
(3:34:35) hoodwinked into thinking that they have money dollars there are no dollars dollars you need a measurement
(3:34:42) which brings up a very famous case the case of Montgomery Wards versus Eugene glacier
(3:34:48) for those of you who want to order the case we'll be happy to give you the court case numbers let me take this off so it doesn't
(3:34:54) reflect too much this is a very famous case okay
(3:34:59) the docket number is 82-002087 this is before The Honorable
(3:35:06) District Court of 52nd 3rd District Court the judge of the record was the
(3:35:11) honorable James P Sheehy okay so now I'll give you a little synopsis
(3:35:17) of this case what happened in this case did everybody get the court number first
(3:35:22) though eight two dash zero zero two zero eight seven all right now
(3:35:28) what happened in this case to make a long story short gentleman's wife got a little mad at him
(3:35:34) decided to take his credit card and go out and charge to Montgomery Wards from the front door to the back door and he ran up quite a large sum debt
(3:35:40) the matter got of course Montgomery Wards well I'm gonna take it back you bought it to church you got it now and
(3:35:46) they went to court and uh came up for the the famous judge James P Sheehy a
(3:35:53) 52nd Third District Court who by the way is a very excellent judge very knowledgeable very very
(3:35:58) a decent man a kindly man at least pretty serious physical so if you're screwing around he's going to hammer you
(3:36:03) but most of the time he's quite congenial and kind of a lot of fun too
(3:36:08) but it came up before his court and up jumped the devil in the deep blue sea and they're starting to argue and the judge saying well let me ask you a
(3:36:14) question he says did you get a credit card he said yeah so you signed for the credit card he said yeah
(3:36:20) so you get a credit card to your wife he said yeah he said here's the bill you pay he says okay judge now let me explain
(3:36:27) something to you you told me that the judgment is for this amount is
(3:36:32) that right and I'm asking you and you told me it's this many dollars and I'm asking you for a determination of the
(3:36:38) dollars what what dollars sure you can interpret it any way you want you can make it frankincense or
(3:36:44) murder I don't care I don't care if you don't even pay his judgment I'll tell you what don't pay it there's a lot of documents in the
(3:36:50) basement they never pay them so don't pay it we'll just take judgment against you and we'll attach it you know
(3:36:56) whatever we need for bits of attachment and what we're going to collect on this debt sir you misunderstood you just
(3:37:02) understood point now you you have told me uh this amount of dollars
(3:37:09) and and I'm I'm confused here I need to know something about these dollars he says well he said let me clarify it for
(3:37:15) you I've entered a judgment against you for the amount due all right he said yes sir but if I ask you for a pound of
(3:37:22) something you're going to say a pound of what and if I ask you for a gallon of something you're gonna say a gallon of what and if I ask you for a foot or a
(3:37:27) yard or something you're gonna say a foot or a yard or what now you're coming to me and telling me dollars and I'm asking you dollars of what because
(3:37:33) dollar is a unit of measurement he said you can make it anything you want tell you what make a coffee beans
(3:37:39) now at that instant the Montgomery Wards attorney came to a half rise and he went
(3:37:45) your honor all right there was 40 of us Plus in the court we
(3:37:50) sat here and all we could do was go because we realized instantly what this judge had just did he had made a
(3:37:56) determination of the substance of the money account of the United States government pursuant to Coffee Beans
(3:38:03) with great Courage the honorable Judge James PC had made a determination if the substance of the money of account in the
(3:38:08) United States government was coffee beans that's what we told the Wall Street Journal and all the newspapers and television stations that would
(3:38:13) listen he was most upset about that
(3:38:19) instantly the judge looked across the room we're all sitting with our jaw on the ground
(3:38:26) and he'll lean back in his chair flipped his pencil in the air and he said ah s with a hit on the record
(3:38:34) he realized that a landmark Michigan court decision had occurred he realized that Montgomery Wards wasn't going to
(3:38:40) say nothing because they won they ain't gonna appeal they won they were they gonna appeal you won you won you won you won it's nothing
(3:38:47) to appeal we weren't gonna appeal because we won two we got the judge to make a determination of the substance of
(3:38:52) the money become the United States government was coffee beans you can see in the back of this book here
(3:38:58) Mr Glacier took the Judgment right here and this was for 1098.97 he did it in 100 bean bags
(3:39:05) certified one bean to the dollar and 97 100 so we cut the tip of the bean
(3:39:10) off painted a white line on it he sent it to Montgomery Wards you got it on there

(3:39:33) matter most graciously yours truly certified mail sent to him they never
(3:39:38) said nothing nor would they nor could they he honored the stipulation of the judge
(3:39:44) okay now to this date this gentleman comes to court with a big red bag marble bag
(3:39:51) full of coffee beans and he's got stenciled on the side jeans beans
(3:39:56) I read you the last statement this is kind of hilarious you it's pretty good
(3:40:03) he's asking for determination of the substance of the money of account I read you about the last three pages
(3:40:10) she goes all right therefore really out of his own
(3:40:15) testimony it seems to me that judgment really is unavoidable in that amount thank you you're out of the Court anything else sir you have the right to
(3:40:22) a closing argument Mr Glacier only that I don't think I received a fair and incredible trial here today to court
(3:40:27) this is a closing argument regarding this trial okay as to the subject matter Mr Glacier subject matter I have nothing
(3:40:33) to add to the subject matter here at the court the court makes the following finding effects that the court finds are pursuant to plants exhibit number one
(3:40:39) and Mr Glacier Eugene Glacier entered into a contract with Montgomery Wards and a company which it is a monthly account
(3:40:45) two pursuant to plans exhibit number two that the account was used by probably 95
(3:40:50) 99 of the time of the purchases by his wife while they were married number three that for Testimony of Mr Davis is
(3:40:57) under about a testimony Mr Davis in the balance owing on the account is 1098.97
(3:41:02) and the court also finds that Mr Grossman Mr Grossman's excuse me from Mr
(3:41:09) glacier's testimony that he just recently got divorced actually August 24 1981 and that divorce proceeding he
(3:41:16) accepted the liability too on this account as between he and his wife based upon the information the court makes a conclusion of law that Mr Eugene glacier
(3:41:22) to kind of this matter owes Montgomery award 1988.97 Court finds a judgment of favor
(3:41:29) plaintiff and the amount of plus costs Mr Glacier you have a right to appeal us and that appeal I think is in 15 or 20

(4:32:42) wake up is now wake up America before it's too late
(4:32:47) before you lose your god-given rights to some foreign potentate
(4:32:52) they might think that you uh you look like a sucker

(4:33:10) the next thing we want to get into is demolition right we want to get into taxes seriously
(4:33:17) closed for today now those of you who have been in militia groups and everybody's getting all panicky let's
(4:33:23) understand a few things about the militia whether you like it or not you are in the militia in the state of
(4:33:29) Michigan and I will tell you right where it says that [Applause]
(4:33:34) article 17 militia right here what does it say
(4:33:41) this is from the night 1850 Constitution all the way back in our state to the Northwest Territories they treaty they
(4:33:48) have a militia the SE an example of what they're talking about the militia shall be composed of all able-bodied male
(4:33:55) citizens between the ages of 18 and 45 years except such as are Exempted by
(4:34:00) laws of the United States and of the state but all such citizens of any religious denomination whatever who from
(4:34:08) Scruples of conscience right in other words if you're a conscientious objector maybe adverse to bearing arms shall be
(4:34:16) excused there from upon such conditions as shall be prescribed by law and they have conscientious objective
(4:34:24) dances okay and you go to the 1908 Constitution just to show you this is the God's truth
(4:34:31) 1908 Michigan Constitution and the Michigan militia show be composed of all able-bodied male citizens between the
(4:34:38) ages of 18 and 45 years of age except such as are Exempted by laws of the United States or of this state but all
(4:34:45) such citizens of any religious denomination who from Scruples of conscience may be adverse to bearing
(4:34:52) arms shall be excused there from upon such conditions as shall be prescribed by love okay
(4:34:58) now that's a 1908 Constitution now you come up here and this just lets
(4:35:04) you know the trend the trend here now
(4:35:10) we're in the 1963 Constitution oh I wanted to show you a little diverse
(4:35:16) thing here this right here common law and statutes and continuance
(4:35:21) in Michigan the common law and the statute laws now enforce not repugnant
(4:35:26) to this constitution shall remain in force unto a expire by their own limitations or a change demented
(4:35:32) repealed so the common law is prevailing simulation here
(4:35:37) we go now notice folks as the thing as the thing goes on it
(4:35:43) gets shorter and shorter here's your militia this is article 3 section four the militia Shelby organized equipped
(4:35:49) and disciplined as provided by law that's all you get now now when you look in the beginning of this constitution
(4:35:56) there is an there is a empowering statutory a phrase that says
(4:36:02) all constitutions before everything they had in them are carried forward to this
(4:36:08) Constitution and that's how they're allowed to do this so what would happen in this case because they haven't clearly defined it
(4:36:14) here they would have to go back in the law to the previous Constitution which would be the 1908 Constitution which we
(4:36:20) just read to you so this wouldn't be the militia shall be
(4:36:25) composable able-bodied male citizens 18 to 45 years of age so that would be the controlling one because that's as
(4:36:30) prescribed by law just like they say does everybody see that now
(4:36:37) the bottom line here folks is a lot of people are all upset about the militia all the militias is concerned citizens
(4:36:44) that are worried about their constitution getting flushed down a toilet we're not putting up with that stuff
(4:36:51) we want people to understand that we love the Constitution we love our country and we're not screwing
(4:36:57) around all right here we go generally
(4:37:03) the militia shall be organized equipped and discipline is provided by law now let's get into that
(4:37:09) single section is substituted for all of this relating to the militia in the present 1908 Constitution remember I
(4:37:16) told you about empowering the existing article ties the legislature down to an
(4:37:22) outvoted concept of what the militia should be you believe that why our four Fighters will be rolling over in their
(4:37:28) grave details as to organizing human disciplining the militia are left through the legislative enactment in the
(4:37:34) interest of the flexibility and future requirements ah does that mean future requirements if it got nasty and down
(4:37:40) and dirty we would have our militia come back sounds good to me I could go for that the bottom line is
(4:37:48) the people that know what's going around are not screwing around they grind the militia there we go all right cool article nine
(4:37:54) let's pull this out the militia organization and discipline the
(4:38:00) legislature provide by law for organizing and disciplining the militia in such manner as they shall deem expedient not incompatible with the
(4:38:07) Constitution and the laws of the United States but they're not doing it right
(4:38:13) the legislature should provide for efficient discipline of the officers Commission in that commission and that
(4:38:18) musicians and or may provide by law for the organization and discipline of the volunteer companies
(4:38:23) volunteer companies notice that volunteer companies huh
(4:38:28) Office of the militia shall be elected or appointed in such manner as the legislature shell from time to
(4:38:35) time direct and shall be commissioned by the governor the governor shall have the power to
(4:38:41) call forth the militia to execute the laws of the state to suppress insurrections and repel invasions that's
(4:38:47) what our forefathers had in mind in the animal issue now if they're going to invade us they're going to change our
(4:38:52) money they're going to shut down our constitution that's why the militia needs to be organized that's why you
(4:38:57) need to be down there talking to a militia that's why you need to be joining the militia I don't care what
(4:39:03) church you go to I don't care what color national origin ethnic background
(4:39:08) you come from you need to be down to the militia and you need to be talking to them folks about this is the United
(4:39:13) States of America and I will protect it and its constitutional form of government and by doing that if we do an
(4:39:20) insufficient numbers most probably what will happen is the New World Order scammers will
(4:39:27) realize ah the people woke up oh we screwed up we'll have to wait another 300 years to try and Pull It Again
(4:39:33) and let's hope that's what happens if that isn't what happens then the militia will defend the Republic just like what our forefathers intended
(4:39:41) and we will defend the Republic as we always do with vigor
(4:39:46) and we will have a government by Constitution that American flag will be on that pool out there and anybody that
(4:39:51) wants to try something different hey knock yourself out but planning a very severe battle
(4:39:57) because we will never give up the United States of America its constitutional government or our American flag or our
(4:40:03) American Heritage so this idea that you're gonna wear us out tie us down otherwise skew us around is nothing but
(4:40:09) a lot of who done it ain't going to happen in your lifetime [Music] as a matter of fact your lifetime may
(4:40:16) not be that long either because we try traders in this country
(4:40:24) and the bottom line is the penalty for treason his death and it's not our purpose to threaten our
(4:40:31) course or otherwise intimidate any person but we want you to understand that this is the United States of America this is a country governed by
(4:40:37) constitutional law that that constitutional law prescribed penalties for criminal acts and that those
(4:40:42) criminal Acts can be punished by a lawful means we're asking all persons
(4:40:49) that are involved in all walks of government are there any areas of the law to please please please
(4:40:56) let's get back to the Constitution and quit screwing around let's just get back
(4:41:03) to what's supposed to be done and quit screwing around pull back your Federalist Papers and
(4:41:10) let's start reading find out everything that's in this book
(4:41:15) is directly applicable today we need to do it over we need to get back to a gold and silver
(4:41:21) standard we need to get back to a serious means of trade expedience that's
(4:41:27) going to hold the standards of our country even we won't have this inflation we won't have this ridiculous
(4:41:32) Market situation we're asking you please before God we're
(4:41:38) asking you we want our constitution we want it back we want all the American principles that we stand for that our
(4:41:44) brave soldiers died for and we're asking you to please quit screwing around let's get down to Brass
(4:41:51) Texas you've been feeding the pablum to the babies too long we're waiting believe me we're way idiot you may not
(4:41:57) think so but I'm here to tell you we're way ahead of you you're going to wake up someday and
(4:42:02) you're going to be shocked we're going to be all standing out there smiling because you're going to be the one that's asleep not us
(4:42:09) we know what we're talking about we're not fooling around we want you to honor our constitution
(4:42:17) God Bless America we want you to keep us safe we want to we want to be into the 21st century
(4:42:23) stronger than we were in the 17th century I'm not fooling around so please
(4:42:29) now we can go into this book and this book clearly establishes they never wanted to have a militia or a standing
(4:42:35) army they only trusted you listen to some of these arguments in here
(4:42:41) okay but it is said that the laws of the Union are to be the supreme law of the
(4:42:47) land what inference can be drawn from this or what would you what would they amount to if they were not to be Supreme
(4:42:53) it is evident they would amount to nothing a law by the very meaning of the term
(4:42:58) includes Supremacy is the rule which those to whom it is prescribed are bound
(4:43:04) to observe this results from every political Association if individuals
(4:43:09) enter into a state of society of laws of that Society must be the Supreme regulator of their conduct
(4:43:15) if a number of political societies entered into a larger political Society the laws which the latter may enact
(4:43:22) pursuant to the powers entrusted and trusted to it by its Constitution must
(4:43:27) necessarily be Supreme over those societies and the individuals of whom they are composed of it would otherwise
(4:43:33) be a mere treaty dependent on good faith of the Prairies and not a government which is only another word for a
(4:43:39) political power and Supremacy but it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of larger society which are not
(4:43:45) pursuant to its constitutional power but which are invasions of the residuary
(4:43:50) authorizes of the smaller societies will become the supreme law of the land these
(4:43:56) will be merely a subversipation which is kind of what's going on and will deserve to be treated as such
(4:44:02) hence we perceive if the clause which declares the supremacy of the laws of the Union like the one we we have just
(4:44:08) before considered only declares a truth which flows immediately and necessarily
(4:44:14) from the institution of the federal government it will not I presume have escaped observation that it expressly
(4:44:21) confines the supremacy to laws made pursuant to the Constitution which I
(4:44:26) mentioned merely as an instance of caution in the convention since the limitation would have been to be
(4:44:31) understood through though it had not been expressed though a law therefore
(4:44:37) for laying a tax for a use of the United States would be Supreme in its nature and could not legally be opposed or
(4:44:43) controlled yet a law for abrogating and preventing the collection of attacks laid by the authority of the state unless upon imports and exports would
(4:44:50) not be the supreme law of the land but undercipation of power not granted by the Constitution as far as an improper
(4:44:57) accumulation of taxes on the same object might tend to render The Collection difficult or precarious
(4:45:03) this would be a mutual inconvenience not arising from the superiority or
(4:45:09) defect of the power now we want to get into some serious arguments here we want to go to page 108
(4:45:17) about the middle of the page accept this to the rule of apportionment the United States have indefinite
(4:45:23) discretion to make requisitions for men and money that means they can ask but they have no authority to raise either
(4:45:29) by regulations extending to the individual citizens of America that's why we don't have a title 26 that
(4:45:35) applies to you the consequences of this is that though in theory their resolution concerning
(4:45:42) those objects are laws constitutionally binding on the members of the Union yet in practice they are mere recommendations which this States
(4:45:48) observe or disregard at their option
(4:45:54) the intent of the framers Cohen versus Virginia six week two eighteen twenty one says this is the
(4:45:59) exact intent is it pretty hard for you to understand what their intent was they never intended to have an internal
(4:46:06) revenue ever they hated people that operated like that
(4:46:14) operated a tyranny against the people all right let's get on with this
(4:46:19) wise politicians will be cautious about fettering the government with restrictions that cannot be observed
(4:46:25) because they know that every breach of the fundamental laws though dictated by necessity impairs that sacred reverence
(4:46:32) which ought to be maintained in the breast of rulers towards the constitution of a country and forms a
(4:46:37) precedent for other breaches where the same plea of necessity does not exist at all or is less urgent and palpable
(4:46:45) Publius and it teaches us in addition to the rest how unequal parchment Provisions
(4:46:51) are to struggle with public necessity you know I mean you start reading you
(4:46:59) got to read don't sit there like a bump on a laundry get all kind of good stuff going here I
(4:47:05) could I could sit here and read this to you all night this constitution
(4:47:10) of the United States that's what you mean in person sir of and all trees made or which show we made under the authority of the United States shall be
(4:47:16) the supreme law of land the judges in every state shall be bound there by anything in Constitution or laws of any state to the contrary is notwithstanding
(4:47:23) the Indiscreet Zeal of the adversaries to the Constitution has betrayed them into an attack on this part of it as
(4:47:30) also without which it would have been evidently and radically defective to be
(4:47:36) fully sensible of this we need only suppose for a moment that the supremacy of the state's Constitution had been
(4:47:42) left complete with a saving clause in their favor in the first place as these constitutions invest the state
(4:47:48) legislature with absolute sovereignty in all cases not accepted but the existing Articles of Confederation all the
(4:47:53) authorities contained in the proposed Constitution remember I told you about how they tied them together so far as they exceed those enumerated
(4:48:01) in the confederation would have been annulled
(4:48:06) see that and the new Congress would have been reduced to the same impotent condition with their predecessors
(4:48:13) I mean these people were Wise Way Beyond their years and this talks about the
(4:48:18) militia they never wanted to have a standing army never they always wanted the people to defend
(4:48:24) by a militia they wanted the militia to be there ready to kick tail if there needed me they wanted to have a Paul Revere running down young the British
(4:48:30) are coming the British are coming or whoever somebody they called them Minutemen they call them Minutemen for a reason
(4:48:37) because they wanted you to grab your kit and be out on the road in a minute ready to kick tail and repel all borders
(4:48:45) that's the way our forefathers thought now they were wise men who had come from a
(4:48:50) a tyrannical environment in the European market places they knew exactly what was going on and they weren't screwing
(4:48:56) around and the bottom line is they were deadly serious and they were ready to sign their life their they pledged their life
(4:49:02) their their future their their fortunes and everything so that we could
(4:49:07) have this Constitution and I think we kind of owe them a debt because a lot of them died miserably as poppers because
(4:49:14) they dared to sign the Declaration of Independence and the King went after them were the Vengeance do you understand
(4:49:20) now the bottom line here is we gotta we got a duty we're gonna finish this thing up we want to do some stuff on taxes and
(4:49:26) then we're gonna we're gonna be out here we're gonna do two things on taxes one is going to be on Title 31 United
(4:49:31) States code section 742 and we're going to Rattle it off if you want the argument later you'll have to get back with us okay
(4:49:39) Bill 31 United States code and we're going to quote it except is otherwise provided by law all
(4:49:46) stocks bonds treasury notes and other obligations of the United States government shall be exempt from the state Municipal and local Authority this
(4:49:53) exemption extends to every form of Taxation that would require you to the obligations are the interest that you're on or both be considered directly or
(4:50:00) indirectly in the computation of the tax see Memphis Bank versus state of Tennessee at elgarner notice this is
(4:50:08) everybody got that that's recorded at volume 459 us page 392.
(4:50:15) okay right here can you see that okay now what this case is this is a
(4:50:22) Supreme Court case that says Title 31 United States code section 742 is the supreme law of land
(4:50:28) and it does so on a diversity of tax arguments based on
(4:50:33) discriminatory franchise of bondholdings but basically what the Supreme Court said was Title 31 section 742 was the
(4:50:40) supreme law of land recorded right in here is exactly what I just quoted to you
(4:50:45) right here except as otherwise provided by law notice it says all stock spans treasure notes and other obligations the
(4:50:52) United States shall be exempt from State taxation my or understate your municipal or local
(4:50:57) Authority now what does this mean what are they talking about here this exemption extends to every form of Taxation that would require that either
(4:51:04) the obligations or the interest you're on or both be considered directly or indirectly in the computation of the tax
(4:51:09) this is a unique test epoxy when the states went off the Article 1 Section 10 gold and silver
(4:51:14) standard you can't pay anyway because of Michigan compile laws act 21.153 you cannot
(4:51:22) tender anything I didn't go over the silver coin to an officer of the government without being a party to a felony on top of that how do they figure the
(4:51:29) taxes let's look at our property taxes this is a big issue a lot of people get involved with this property taxes
(4:51:34) they're tired of being taxed right out of their home this tax argument is specifically for you
(4:51:42) they come to your house they set a value on your house they tell you that oh uh your house is worth a hundred thousand
(4:51:47) dollars so we're gonna tax it at a 50 interest which would be fifty thousand dollars that's a 50 amortization value
(4:51:54) we'll figure your house is a fifty thousand dollar uh bracket area and then we're gonna go seven points on that
(4:52:00) seven percent and or whatever the percentage is now stop for a second here
(4:52:05) how did they figure the value on your house only said fifty thousand dollars there
(4:52:12) is no dollars what dollars you ain't got no dollars you got dollars I ain't got no dollars dollars or what dollars of
(4:52:19) coffee beans I don't think so the bottom line is they stay talking Federal Reserve notes and they're
(4:52:25) putting the commodity item at the at the reserve notes now what did they just do accepts otherwise provided by law oh
(4:52:31) stocks bonds treasury notes what is it what is the Federal Reserve Note it's a treasury note in other obligations of the United
(4:52:38) States what what obligations title 12 section 411 says the said notes shall be deemed to be obligations of the United
(4:52:44) States government whoops now wait a minute let's see let's
(4:52:50) look at this again except as otherwise provided by law all stocks bonds treasury notes and other obligations of
(4:52:55) the United States shall be exempt from taxation buyer understate or Municipal of local Authority does that mean they can't
(4:53:02) figure a tax by use and obligation to the United States government you're right you're
(4:53:08) absolutely right this exemption extends to every form of Taxation that would require either the obligations
(4:53:14) or the interest they're on or both be considered directly or indirectly in the computation of the tax
(4:53:21) now what are they doing when they figure this 50 amortization of value and then they add so many points percent on and
(4:53:28) they attacked that on and they they saw you owe us this much
(4:53:33) aren't they using Federal Reserve notes indirectly they are aren't they and they're forbidden from doing that
(4:53:38) and the Supreme Court says this is the supreme law of land well guess what folks this case was originally brought in a
(4:53:44) matter of people versus Shepherd out of Lansing and after that case they went in all the
(4:53:50) law books and they pulled out Title 31 section 742 that's how scared they are this title
(4:53:56) we went to Shepherd citations and we noted it in Shepherd citations there was no note that says a nulled repair
(4:54:02) repealed or otherwise transferred to some other law
(4:54:09) there's a hole there folks it starts at seven it starts at Title 31 section 734
(4:54:14) and there's a hole and then it goes to 752 perhaps you in good shape I said I'm going to show you how good a
(2:34:20) shape I mean you keep calling me pops he says no no no no you don't understand pops he said if you're an older
(2:34:26) gentleman in the joint they treat you with courtesy they call you Pops that's just out of courtesy I said oh I guess
(2:34:31) you can call me pops and that's cool so don't you ever think that I'm getting old
(2:34:37) South for you so they laughed when I left they lined up to shake my hand and uh even the
(2:34:43) Jailer said he was going to be sorry I meant to see me go because I was helping so many people and people were getting
(2:34:48) their lives together and so when I go to jail it's kind of unique I actually get a vacation I got the top hunk and I laid
(2:34:55) on the window and let God's sunshine in my face and I got a suntan and guys would say pops why do you climb up on
(2:35:00) the top punk I said man I'm out on the beach getting sun and raised what are you doing he said you know pops you something else
(2:35:06) you're gonna make you in jail and you're gonna make I said I'm laying out here on the beach what you talking about
(2:35:12) I'm laying on my bed right next to the window and the Sun comes right through and I'm on the beach what are you talking about getting the sun tan
(2:35:20) so you got to make the best of where you're at no matter what it keeps your spirits up
(2:35:25) and the bottom line is this I wouldn't have been in jail if I could have more effectively argued my
(2:35:31) Constitution I ended up having to do a brief from the jail 28 pages I sharpen the pencil on the
(2:35:38) phone on the wall there it is this is a 28-page motion Edition this is
(2:35:44) more than that this right here this right here I mean this is all
(2:35:50) from hand longhand and when we got to court the judge looked at it he goes sir
(2:35:55) are you an attorney I says no he says he says uh you've been to law school I
(2:36:03) says no sir he says you did this from jail I says yes sir he says you did this from jail
(2:36:09) from memory I says yes sir that's rather extensive it's huge meanwhile the prosecutor kicks in she
(2:36:16) says Joshua I got to answer this he goes oh hell this guy is kind of like this guy on night court on TV and channel 2
(2:36:21) kind of flip it and he says oh hell yeah counselor he says what's this a new hobby you just
(2:36:28) took up he says uh this guy even did his own proposed order I don't even have to fill out an order
(2:36:33) he says not only and I want it done by 8 o'clock Monday morning so all weekend she had to go to law library and answer all this stuff
(2:36:40) she was not a happy camper so then she uh proposed that I have to have a shrink check my bolts out to see if my
(2:36:47) batteries are charged because if you defend your Constitution you got to be a crazy uh turkey
(2:36:55) and she found out I'm pretty well squared away I just argue my Constitution I asked the
(2:37:01) judges this is a God in this bad yet judge so what do you got touched in a nut house because you defend your Constitution he says not in my court and
(2:37:07) I've heard of Judges speaking out and saying well the Constitution has no place in my courtroom how can they even
(2:37:13) think about that wait where that is a that is a very serious statement
(2:37:21) because what that judge just did in an open court alone or Title 18 United States code section 2381 as he just
(2:37:28) committed an act of treason see the judges sworn under article 11 in this state paragraph one and he will
(2:37:34) uphold the Constitution of the United States and move as most immediately as is practicable defend the Constitution and a violation of that act
(2:37:41) would be Capital felony treason under the people and government of the United States of America and he would be subject and upon conviction to be hung
(2:37:48) by the neck that's how serious if the defendant had a driver's license and they were trying to argue a traffic
(2:37:53) matter and they were kind of in the system already and raised the Constitutional objection that the judge
(2:37:58) might say it doesn't apply well here's here's how we start a lot of these traffic cases and I'll get right into that the issue when you first walk
(2:38:05) before a traffic court you see when they merge these courts together in 1963 they
(2:38:11) screwed up they they wanted they wanted to lay off after judges see and they only wanted to have one building so what
(2:38:17) they did is they merged the traffic court per se or the or that docket into
(2:38:22) the criminal court docket and when they did that they didn't check the rules
(2:38:28) you see and when they didn't check the rules they didn't allow for jurisdictional challenges between the
(2:38:34) two courts so what happens now is you come before the court and there's
(2:38:40) several ways you can come before the court no this gentleman here is correct when he's talking about you have a
(2:38:46) driver's license you have entered into a contractual relationship with the state
(2:38:52) in other words it's not a lawful contract because you cannot enter into an unlawful contract you understand it
(2:38:58) is a contract though because it's recognized as a contract because you have voluntarily entered
(2:39:05) into this contract you agreed to all of the rules in their law book for that
(2:39:10) contract now this is what we call admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction or artificial jurisdiction
(2:39:16) and it's a rather heavy argument going into area railroad versus Tompkins and McCulloch versus Maryland and we'll go
(2:39:22) into that in depth at the end of this program but I wanted to share with you briefly when you sign your driver's license and
(2:39:29) especially today and your voter's registration card you will notice a little note right under
(2:39:36) your signature where you agree to the acceptance of The Duality of
(2:39:41) citizenship of not only at the common law but you accept the national jurisdiction under admiralty and
(2:39:47) Maritime jurisdiction which allows you to be sucked into all these Uniform Commercial Code requirements
(2:39:53) and this is a very serious thing you're saying here you don't understand it but you just sold all your constitutional
(2:39:59) rights down the sewer when you signed that document so when you sign it my honest advice and this is a firm
(2:40:05) experience you sign the thing and right at the end of your name you write
(2:40:10) UD U period D period at the end of your name and underneath your name you write
(2:40:16) 1-207 without prejudice now what that does it says I'll be glad to accept your
(2:40:22) uh your ridiculous privilege I don't really need to but I will just to keep myself from being in trouble with the
(2:40:27) cops and I'll tell you what we'll do we'll uh we'll exercise our Uniform Commercial
(2:40:34) Code caveat that allows us to keep all of our constitutional rights in other words my signature is not really a
(2:40:39) signature of contract it's a signature of convenience that allows me to get a piece of paper
(2:40:45) to put in my pocket for identification purposes that allows me to sign my checks and do whatever I got to do
(2:40:51) but it doesn't in any way make any admissions or confessions or require me to participate in any of your rulebook
(2:40:57) schemes under your admiralty and Maritime taunting scheme now to tell you how crazy it was I just got discussed by an attorney
(2:41:03) how he would defend how he would defend a program where a gentleman that he was defending
(2:41:11) was accused of hijacking a car and that they were claiming that because the car is made all over the world and all over
(2:41:17) the United States that the parts even though they're assembled at one point they are in what is called
(2:41:23) the the interstate
(2:41:29) jurisdiction and that because of that this current this crime was now a federal crime you
(2:41:35) understand this is how far reaching this thing has gotten and when this gentleman signed his driver's license he had no idea that he
(2:41:42) was entering into this thing and waving all of his god-given constitutional rights and that he was no longer a
(2:41:48) common law citizen that he was actually under annualty in Maritime jurisdiction now
(2:41:53) when we pull up some of these statutory requirements it's an interesting thing that you brought up
(2:41:59) but what they do is they're never these regulations are never enacted into law
(2:42:04) uh we'll show you something on that just a little bit later but they're not an accidental law they just make a
(2:42:09) regulation and because you you voluntarily enter into this contract all of these regulations just come up as
(2:42:16) enforceable to you even though you don't know any better now we have a Fair Credit Reporting Act
(2:42:22) that says if you make any loan or you get involved in any kind of a credit relationship they got to tell you everything about how much the interest
(2:42:28) rate is what the payments are how long the payments I mean they got to tell you every single thing about the contract
(2:42:33) and in theory all contracts you're supposed you're supposed to know all of the facts in
(2:42:39) regard to the contract they just make the contract one-sided and they figure well these people are not that we're informed they're not real bright we'll
(2:42:46) just get them to sign the senator driver's license and they'll voluntarily acquiesce into the situation and then we can throw all of these regulations at
(2:42:51) them and they'll never know how we we hit them so it's very important that you understand when you sign something read
(2:42:57) it for sure if you don't understand everything that's down there take it to somebody and ask some questions before you sign
(2:43:04) it because once you sign it it's harder to get out of
(2:43:09) but I highly recommend everybody lose their wallet and go down and redo their driver's license and sign a thing UD
(2:43:14) when you sign it and put 1-207 without prejudice because right then and there
(2:43:19) you cut off all of this admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction and you return back to your contract law
(2:43:27) of what you're a common law citizen living at the common law
(2:43:32) and they can have their contract but it's not enforceable why is it not enforceable because you can state that
(2:43:37) you sign it under duress well how do I know that look I put UD right after my name you period we think that means
(2:43:43) under development under the deck that means that means under duress
(2:43:52) when I signed this I was under duress I didn't voluntarily sign this I had to sign this or the cops were going to Cuff
(2:43:58) me about the head you see I was under threat intimidation
(2:44:04) coercion I still believe that I have a right to travel freely uncumber notice you're not driving you have a right to
(2:44:09) travel the customary usage of the right to travel today is you get in the car you don't go down to 7-Eleven on your
(2:44:15) bicycle you get in your car I want to go down and pick up a carton of milk you get in your car another unique argument
(2:44:20) along these lines is well judge I asked this judge I says let me ask you a question judge if I get in my car
(2:44:27) the Constitution was still in effect in full force before I got in my car right oh yeah now when I got in my car and I
(2:44:34) had my gun it was still in effect right but when I closed the door
(2:44:40) the Constitution was suspended and everybody broke out laughing how could that be
(2:44:47) the act of getting in the car and closing the door made the Second Amendment unconstitutional
(2:44:52) I said that's totally ludicrous how could that possibly be
(2:45:01) you see they have passed these laws and when they've gotten away with it for so long that they just it's kind of like a bank
(2:45:08) robber that's robbed 25 banks in a row and on the 26 is a little miffed at you getting excited man I've done this 25
(2:45:13) times what's the big deal now you're going to bust me on the 26th time and you're going to get all upset
(2:45:21) see they've been getting away with it so long nobody's ever taken them to the task or they feel like well I should be
(2:45:27) able to get away with it on the 26th time an unconstitutional Act
(2:45:33) wrongfully done it doesn't matter how many times in a row you did it it's still unconstitutional
(2:45:40) and the reality is a person that's properly motivated properly trained and properly willing to do whatever is
(2:45:45) necessary and proper to defend the Constitution will almost always prevail on the merits and that's what we're
(2:45:50) doing right now and they're sweating on that right now but the reality of this is and you got
(2:45:55) to understand the burden is on you you want your Constitution and you damn
(2:46:01) well better grab a hold of it and you better hold on tight and you don't let go for nothing you read your Constitution you learn
(2:46:07) your Constitution you quote your Constitution chapter and verse frontwards backwards upside down when people come up to you well we want you
(2:46:13) to take a drug test as part of your job huh Go Fish
(2:46:18) are you taking a drug test I'm not required to prove a negative you're required to prove a positive if
(2:46:24) you think I'm doing something negligent fine and you go file papers and you take necessary precautions and what have you
(2:46:29) and we'll go to court I says but I'm not I'm not going to be convicted before the fact and then I got to provide evidence
(2:46:35) that I'm not guilty that's the cart before the horse that's back ass words we're not going to
(2:46:42) do that not only that the Fifth Amendment says I gotta write not to be a participant
(2:46:48) in a compulsory process that's going to make an incriminating situation to be now I'm not nothing to hide and I'm not
(2:46:54) even arguing from what I got to hide I'm arguing from the fact that the right stands and I'm exercising it
(2:47:00) and then I usually ask some simple questions well if they find anything when I get fired
(2:47:05) hell yeah you're gonna be penalized so there are penalties
(2:47:10) and if they find anything would I be criminally prosecuted could be huh
(2:47:17) so why would you want to do some damn stupid thing like that I'll give them a piss test this guy comes up to me at the
(2:47:22) last convention we had and they want to take a test that's the weather now he's uh he's got
(2:47:29) any drugs in his system that's first of all what's in my system is between me and my doctor none of your damn business
(2:47:34) I says I don't take drugs but I got nothing to hide but I'm not going to voluntarily enter in anything what if
(2:47:39) your guy screws up and now you say I Got Drugs now I can't get a job ever what are you kidding me there's some new
(2:47:44) hobby you just took up I'm not going to play that game it is not my burden to prove a negative it is
(2:47:50) your burden to prove a positive if you have a just claim for which relief can be granted you go file your papers and
(2:47:56) we'll sit down and talk but until such time you go fish
(2:48:02) because I'm not gonna play I'm not required to play and I'm not gonna play and if you fire me for the
(2:48:08) exercise of my constitutional right I'm going to tell you about United Miller versus United States which says the
(2:48:13) claim and exercise of a constitutional rights shall not be converted into a crime and you're doing that and you're
(2:48:18) punishing me and if you fire me for it I will sue your socks off and attach everything you own Bank business and
(2:48:23) home now make my day that's how I feel about it so you find another turkey to jerk
(2:48:30) with because I'm not gonna play okay now we want to get into some serious things I want to get into this uh
(2:48:36) this argument about traffic cases this is the most practical way to deal with traffic cases
(2:48:43) when you are pulled over what is happening now you got a policeman he's conducting Discovery anything you say
(2:48:49) can and will be held against you and if you don't think so just keep rattling and it'll all get written down on the
(2:48:55) ticket I found that out told Oscar you just been waiting to get this ticket so we can fight and beat it always be in court ruled that word for word right on
(2:49:01) the ticket so when these people are with you you keep your hatch button and I mean I'm
(2:49:06) guilty I admit that sometimes I rattle on it's been known to happen
(2:49:12) so I'm telling you not to do it you button your hands if you say anything it's yes sir no sir what can I do for
(2:49:18) you and they always like to say going a little fast weren't you I say I need to admit or denying I leave
(2:49:23) you your proofs oh a lawyer yeah I'm not a lawyer but
(2:49:28) I'm smart enough to keep my mouth shut because I realize anything I say is going to be putting down on your paper and say you got to charge you make it
(2:49:34) and I'll see you in court oh you want to go to court oh yeah I always go to court I fight everything Murder One
(2:49:40) kind of like a hobby of mine you know
(2:49:46) well let's see what we get and they walk back to the car and they start right
(2:49:51) or they usually come back and they say well you're going a little fast think about slowing down we're gonna let you go with the warning you gotta have a
(2:49:58) good day thank you officer you have a good day too God bless you and keep you safe
(2:50:04) okay courtesy I can blow their doors off anytime I want still yes sir no sir
(2:50:10) courtesy courtesy Pace you treat people the way you like to be treated nine times out of ten you will benefit
(2:50:16) you treat people like a Yahoo and you're gonna get treated like a Yahoo yourself so I I highly recommend courtesy as a an
(2:50:22) effective way I had a policeman one time tell me you ever eat a flashlight the hard way
(2:50:28) and I looked at him and I said quite frankly officer most of the officers I have run into are
(2:50:35) extremely professional and I treat them with a great deal of courtesy and professionalism because I respect what
(2:50:42) they're doing and that they risk their life every day and at no time when I give an officer
(2:50:47) enough static that he would want them make me eat a flashlight I mean I treat them
(2:50:52) very cordially and I respect what they're trying to do I don't agree with everything they're trying to do because some of the stuff is kind of unlawful
(2:51:00) I said but I will give them the courtesy they have coming he turned to me and he said I'm sorry I
(2:51:07) got a big mouth I didn't mean it you're right I was out of line see you treat people with courtesy and
(2:51:14) nine times out of ten you can even back down some guy that's talking a lot of manure
(2:51:20) but the louder you talk and the more belligerent you talk the more louder and the more belligerent he has to talk it's
(2:51:26) kind of like Newton's third law of physics every action has an opposite opposing reaction you talk crap then
(2:51:31) he's gotta talk crap so my advice to people is don't do that it's unmotivated who's doing this you or him remember the
(2:51:38) best weapon you have is the one right between your ears so use it and watch your mouth don't be talking a
(2:51:45) lot of trash to these policemen they don't need to hear it and they got a bad day he might have a bad day
(2:51:51) best thing to do is say yes or no sir if you got an honest pitch go ahead make my day now we've gone past that you got the
(2:51:58) ticket what are you gonna do well look on the ticket see if he signed it a lot of times they don't sign it
(2:52:04) guess what if he didn't sign it there ain't no sworn complaint how can you defend against the non-sworn complaint
(2:52:11) a lot of times the cop doesn't sign the ticket look open your eyes God gave you a set
(2:52:18) of eyes look yeah this guy didn't sign it today it says under penalty of perjury I I attest
(2:52:25) and certified that this is a true and fact complaint well what happens if you don't sign that it ain't a complaint
(2:52:33) police officer that situation don't they make you sign the tickets sometimes they do if you sign it put UD 1-207 without prejudice
(2:52:40) that's saying that's saying that you you received the complaint that's all that's saying all right so
(2:52:48) one day is 207 it's not an admission of this means that you received the complaint okay
(2:52:55) if you don't sign it he's going to take you to jail that's I mean I realize that it's unconstitutional unless you like
(2:53:01) jail food you know I wouldn't do it I'd sign the thing UD 1-207 without prejudice
(2:53:07) the signature doesn't do anything besides you want to copy the complaint anyway because you want to file a brief
(2:53:12) are you going to file the brief if you don't know what the complaint is right now the next thing you know you have to
(2:53:18) notify the court within the time period and it's usually 10 days one of their dirtiest tricks is you call in and you
(2:53:24) think you got it notice and guess what they claim you didn't call in
(2:53:30) and they go ahead and say you didn't show up and they find you guilty and bingo you're out of there so I recommend
(2:53:37) you call them tell them that you want a formal hearing ask the name of the party
(2:53:42) you are speaking to and who am I speaking to so that you've got a name of
(2:53:48) somebody that works there to verify that you called then immediately a sooner type up a little notice that says I
(2:53:56) State your full name do you hereby request a formal hearing put that in the mail sent certified mail to them
(2:54:03) or run down there and there and walk right in and get them to set up a hearing now you want a formal hearing
(2:54:09) okay now five days before that hearing you are required to serve your papers on opposing Council if you don't do it in a
(2:54:17) timely fashion Michigan General Court rule will sock it to you and you will not be able to enter your briefs now sometimes you can get away with it the
(2:54:23) last minute handing it to him and they won't say nothing but if they want to hear me they can use the 5D Court rule I
