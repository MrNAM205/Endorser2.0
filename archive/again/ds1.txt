(00:00) Everybody's at different stages in this learning game of the great awakening because we're all waking up across the
(00:07) country. This is a biblical thing. Nobody made it up, at least not on this
(00:13) earth anyway. But, uh, we know exactly what's going to go on, approximate time frames
(00:20) of what's going to happen. And right now, we're in
(00:26) a an exciting time to be alive.
(00:35) the this is a war between good and evil. It's also a war between we the people
(00:42) and the bar association. The bar association is a
(00:48) cause of the vast majority of problems we have in America and the world. They
(00:54) own and control everything. I got a a good friend. He's fairly
(01:02) young. His name is Justin. And Justin sailed through high school. He has the
(01:09) ability to read and retain every word, every page, every page number, look it
(01:17) up later, know where it is, what book it came out of, who wrote it. Just blows my
(01:22) mind. His level of competency. two years of law school and he got a jur
(01:29) doctorate after high school. Probably one of the youngest attorneys I've ever seen. Passed the bar on his first try
(01:36) with an 800 score. Nobody does that. And he went to
(01:42) work for one of the largest law firms in Seattle. And at his celebration party,
(01:50) they rented the Space Needle for a celebration party for the night. And so
(01:56) the entire law firm had it. They had dinner and then Justin's standing there and he's looking out the windows at the
(02:03) city lights of Seattle and the main partner of the law firm walked up and
(02:08) put his arm around Justin and he said, "What do you see out
(02:14) there? Do who who do you think controls all of
(02:20) that? We've got some of the largest companies in the world. We've got Microsoft and Amazon and Boeing right
(02:27) here in Seattle. Who do you think controls those? Who do you think controls the little mom and pop stores
(02:33) down there on the pier and downtown? Who do you think controls the state of Washington's
(02:40) government and all the little municipalities and the and the county governments? Who do you think controls
(02:48) all that? And Justin proceeded to say, 'Well, we the people elect our representatives and
(02:54) they control government and the CEOs make the decisions for the corporations.
(03:03) And the leading law partner let out a big old belly laugh and he he says,
(03:12) "No, not one CEO, not one legislator makes a
(03:18) decision. Not one invoice, not one piece of sales literature, not one
(03:25) contract is written by any of them. They're written by us.
(03:31) They don't make a decision without running it past their legal
(03:37) department. We, the bar association, makes the decisions that run the
(03:45) world. And Justin looked him in the eye, shook his hand, and said, "I
(03:51) quit." And now he's helping the people with the law. He tore his bar cart up
(03:57) and he walked out and he threw it away. Okay, I'm really proud of
(04:03) him. Over the years, I've probably got 20 or 30 attorneys to tear up their bar
(04:08) cards and I've got judges that help us because they understand once I've
(04:17) taught them the basics that they didn't know what the law was. They didn't know its origin. They
(04:25) didn't know what it came from. If I was to ask you, where did the law come from? What's its origin? How did we arrive at
(04:32) this thing called law where a small group of men could put something down on paper and try and hold me, a man,
(04:39) accountable? Could you answer that question?
(04:46) You watched my video. Okay. No, actually, it wasn't. It was Genesis
(04:52) 1:26-28. God gave me man dominion over the land,
(04:58) the air, and the water. And this is law. The land became common law, common
(05:05) all mankind. It's property, its equity, its rights. It's our rights. They're
(05:12) unalenable. What does unalenable mean? They cannot place a lean upon our
(05:19) rights. That's what it means. Those rights are
(05:26) unalenable. It has to do with things of property nature, patents and grants and
(05:34) securities, gold and silver, commodities, things we own, right?
(05:40) Things we own. That's what common law is. It deals with properties and it
(05:47) deals with our rights. The air which is the highest form of law.
(05:54) The air is above the land which is above the water. The air is ecclesiastical or
(06:01) canon law which is trust law. All things held in trust held in the benefit of
(06:07) another are errors. It's trust law. That's all it
(06:13) is. in Genesis 1:26 through Genesis
(06:19) 2:25 is a trust indenture. Why did God start that off
(06:25) right in the very beginning of the Bible? He put the world under trust to
(06:31) mankind. We're the trustees. He's the executive.
(06:37) He placed it to us to manage for the benefit of our beneficiaries, our future
(06:44) heirs for generations to come. Lives on in perpetuity forever. And what is the
(06:50) definition of forever until the end of the earth? Forever is till the end of the
(06:58) earth. Then we're in eternity. Okay? So it lives on in
(07:04) perpetuity forever. The jurisdiction of the water is
(07:10) admiraly law. It is commerce. It's contract
(07:17) law. Things held in contract with another. Now, there's some interesting
(07:23) elements to a true contract that the bar association doesn't want to teach you.
(07:29) the bar association teach you there's got to be an agreement consideration and both people have to sign
(07:37) and you've got a contract. Well, that's not true. There's eight elements of a contract. Okay. But one of the most
(07:45) important of those elements is a contract has to be between like kind. Can a man write a contract with a man?
(07:52) Yes. And when I use the word man today, that means mankind. Not being gender
(07:58) specific. It's mankind. It's our species. Okay. So, a man can have a
(08:06) contract with a man, but a corporation has to have a contract with a
(08:11) corporation. Can a man have a contract with a corporation?
(08:18) No. Can't. It's like kind versus like kind. Why did they put things in
(08:25) corporations? Anybody know? Why did they start doing that?
(08:35) So that people are in the corporation not only the assets. You're you're
(08:41) exactly right. It's to limit liability.
(08:47) So if a man has integrity,
(08:52) purpose, knows all eight elements of a contract and writes a proper contract where there's a meeting of the minds.
(09:00) There's full and honest disclosure of the terms and conditions of the contract. There's equal consideration
(09:05) where one person gives something up and one receives and the other gives something up and the other receives. Has
(09:12) to be a two-way street. If that's true, why do they have to form
(09:20) corporations? No, I'm I'm serious. The reason is is because lack of
(09:27) integrity. If we had integrity, we'd never need a corporation. If we were honest, we'd never need a corporation.
(09:35) Corporations exist so that people can take be taken advantage
(09:42) of. Yeah. because they have no integrity. So, that's a that's a pretty
(09:48) sad thing. Um, and one of the main things we got to
(09:54) learn is the United States of America is not
(10:00) the same thing as the United States. It's not the same thing as USA,
(10:06) Inc., Salt Lake County is not the same thing
(10:14) as the county of Salt Lake. Salt Lake City is not the same
(10:20) thing as Salt Lake City incorporated.
(10:28) Okay? You are not the same thing as your all caps name.
(10:36) So my name David Lester Strait spelled in all capital letters is not the same
(10:43) as David Lester straight in upper and lower case. What happened is a vessel was
(10:52) created a vessel and the law clearly talks about vessels over and over and
(10:58) over again. Why am I talking so much about
(11:05) law? It's because kindergarten through 12th grade, how many law classes did you have? Why?
(11:14) That's right. The moment you turned 15 years old and got a permit to operate a motor vehicle that
(11:21) you didn't even need, you've been dealing with the
(11:26) law and yet you never had any classes. They teach you algebra. How much algebra
(11:31) have you used since you got out of high school? Not much. No, most people
(11:37) haven't. Okay. So, they teach us things we don't necessarily need and leave out the
(11:43) things that we do. I thought it was a government funded, government controlled curriculum, government school
(11:53) system. At some point in time, somebody's got to take responsibility for our education. Who's
(12:00) that going to be? I don't think it should be should be our
(12:07) parents. You know, it really should. Our parents are responsible. That's one of the reasons I
(12:14) feel so lucky. I had great parents and they taught me to question
(12:21) authority. Now, that my school that I went to told me not to question
(12:27) authority. So in my early days, my parents went in one ear and out
(12:33) the other and the school sunk in and I obeyed authority in the early
(12:38) days. Okay. And that always gets you into
(12:45) trouble. So what city are we in? Riverton. So if
(12:50) the city of Riverton police drove in right now, who are they? Do you know?
(12:58) statute code enforcements. Well, that's right. It says policy on the side of their car. Police is policy. They're
(13:07) policy enforcement agents. Doesn't say law enforcement. It's policy. Supreme Court of the United
(13:13) States says rules, codes, statutes, and ordinances
(13:18) are not law. They're not law. They're corporate bylaws.
(13:25) They're for employees of the corporation to fall off. So, are you an employee of the
(13:32) corporation of the city of Riverton? Unfortunately,
(13:38) not for this discussion. Okay. You're
(13:44) not, but you are because you consented. And what I mean by that is you
(13:50) volunteered and you call yourself you selfdetermined. Your very first
(13:56) foundational cornerstone unalenable right is your right of self-determination. The church teaches
(14:02) it as free agency. Right? That's the right to self-determine. What's right?
(14:08) What's wrong? So, you self-determine that you're a citizen, a
(14:15) person, and a resident. And if you are, you need CPR
(14:22) because you're dead. You're a dead entity. You ever heard the term all are
(14:27) equal in the law, rich or poor, black or white, y'all have equal standing, things
(14:33) like that? It's because you're all dead.
(14:40) What is an indictment? An indictment is a true bill. Says that right at the bottom of
(14:45) every indictment. It's a bill. It's an invoice. Did you bother to ask how much is the bill if you were
(14:52) indicted? No. Nobody does. So, you're brought up on charges. You don't pay the
(14:57) charges, you're asked to bond. If you don't pay the bond, your body is held assured you for the bond.
(15:04) Well, they collect from your
(15:09) sust. Do you understand? Those are all banking terms. So, what is a court? Look up the
(15:16) word court in a legal dictionary. It says C bank, C post office. You look up
(15:22) the word judge, it says C banker, C postmaster. Everything is banking. Do
(15:30) you know you have a 72-hour ride of recision on everything? You get a ticket from a
(15:36) police officer and he gives you a ticket for speeding down the road, you can resend that ticket within 72
(15:43) hours. So, I didn't ask, do we have any police officers in the room? Any
(15:49) attorneys? Any government agents? That's a shame. I wish you guys had some of those around because I'd love to debate
(15:56) them for just a little bit. Take I take a red Sharpie in a 45 degree
(16:03) angle. I write your offer to contract is not accepted while traveling in private my private
(16:09) automobile. You operate under title 18 section 241 and 242 as a conspiracy to
(16:16) deprive me of my rights under the color law and I mail it back in
(16:22) even if it's feeding no matter what. Here's some case law. Operation of
(16:30) a motor vehicle upon public streets and highways is not a mere privilege, but is a right or liberty protected by the
(16:36) guarantees of federal and state constitutions. The use of the highways for the purpose of travel and
(16:42) transportation is not a mere privilege, but a common and fundamental right of which the public and the individual
(16:48) cannot be rightfully deprived. No state government entity has the power to allow or deny passage upon the highways.
(16:54) Transporting his vehicles and personal property for either recreation or business. Travel is not a privilege that
(17:00) can be permitted at will with forced insuranceances, registration, or licensing, but a common and fundamental
(17:06) right of liberty granted by the constitution. Okay. Where can we find
(17:11) that? The use of the automobile that I got pages and pages of pages. I carry a folder in my pickup like this.
(17:19) that is about that thick and no cop can argue with it. It's
(17:27) got Supreme Court decisions. It's got case law. It's got everything. What is case law, by the way? Already
(17:33) determined. No, it's the opine. The opinion of a judge is somebody's
(17:40) opinion. Do you understand? No matter what side of the fence you're on or what subject you're arguing about, you can
(17:46) find case law that supports your opinion. Okay? What do attorneys get taught in
(17:53) law school? Case law. Case law. Case law. Case law. That's it. I've proved to
(18:00) attorneys before that they didn't learn the law in law school. See, there's three types of law.
(18:06) There's superior law, supreme law, and corporate
(18:12) bylaws. That's it. Supreme
(18:17) law is laws given to us by God. They're
(18:24) unalenable. Okay? They're the Ten Commandments and more. It's not just 10,
(18:31) guys. That's just the most important ones. Okay? They're
(18:37) unalenable. Supreme law. And the whole reason we have state and federal supreme
(18:42) courts is our constitutions and our treaties. Those are supreme
(18:49) laws. The purpose of the Supreme Court is to see if a lower court decision
(18:56) conforms to the Constitutions and treaties of the United States of America. That's their only
(19:03) job. when they the Supreme Court hears a case. And by the way, you got a 5%
(19:10) chance of getting a case before the Supreme Court. 5%. That's it. Out of all
(19:16) the ones that submitted, only 5% get heard. But their only job is to see if
(19:24) the decisions of the lower courts conform to our constitutions and treaties. Do you know that's we the
(19:31) people's job? It's not up to them. We're supposed to nullify them. We're supposed to nullify
(19:38) them through our juries and we're supposed to nullify them every time we
(19:44) get a letter in the mail that's addressed to our all caps
(19:49) name. When you get a letter in the mail, you have a 72-hour right to
(19:55) resend to correct the errors our public servants make and to educate them so
(20:01) they don't do it again. That's your job. That's all of our jobs. And you know
(20:07) what we haven't done the last hundred years? We haven't corrected any of their
(20:15) errors. They make these tremendous they call clerical errors and we don't
(20:23) correct them then we acquance. Government operates through
(20:29) the consent of the governed. What does that mean? That means they presume
(20:38) something. See if you guys can see this.
(20:43) They presume something. They
(20:50) assume something. They get your tacid
(20:57) agreement that you're a citizen person and a resident, so you need
(21:03) CPR. And then they use hearsay
(21:12) to convict you, put you in jail, charge you a fine or a fee or a tax or whatever it may
(21:18) be. They say it's to tax the poor which might not otherwise be taxed. So they
(21:25) lead you down a path. They railroad you. What is the legal definition of the
(21:32) term railroad? to lead someone down a narrow path or rail to a predetermined outcome
(21:38) or conclusion. Predetermined. How do I know
(21:44) it's predetermined? I'll tell you my best confirmation of
(21:49) it. About five years ago in the Ninth District federal courthouse in front of
(21:55) Judge Mosman, the lead judge of the ninth district, which was known as the
(22:00) most liberal district of our federal courts.
(22:07) I brought a case and the case I
(22:12) brought was basically there was a grandmother who was found guilty before
(22:21) I met her by a jury. She was tried and found guilty of four felony counts of
(22:32) fraud. She did nothing wrong. nothing. But they spent four days in a
(22:40) trial railroading her and then gave her half a day to defend herself and denied
(22:46) all of her witnesses, denied all of her evidence. What's she going to do then?
(22:54) Don't you have a right to defend yourself? Don't you have a right to a face your
(22:59) accusers? They didn't care. They said basically told her she had no
(23:06) rights. She couldn't bring the Constitution up in the courtroom. They did the same thing to Shauna Cox and
(23:12) Ryan Bundy, the Bundy's. They said, "Don't bring that Bible into the
(23:18) courtroom. Don't bring that Constitution into the courtroom." Why did they say that?
(23:24) Separation of church state. No, it's because you're not a party to it. Did you know that? Did you know that you
(23:31) guys aren't a party to the Bible? And you're not a party to the Constitution. What does that mean? Ah,
(23:40) I'm about to tell you. Give me just a moment. So, let me finish with Judge Mosman for a
(23:46) minute. What I proved with Judge Mosman is that there's two
(23:54) governments. that there's a dure government of we the people where we the people lay down the
(24:01) law and a government steps outside of their scope and authority of the law in which we the people lay down. Then
(24:09) they're committing felonies. They're committing imoluments violation.
(24:15) Okay, that's article one section six clause 8 of the constitution. An
(24:20) emolement violation. What is an emolement? Anybody know? It's where we pay them to do
(24:28) something that we lay down that we tell them what to do and they act outside of
(24:35) that scope and authority and they collect a fee from us. It's not part of their job
(24:41) description. It's not part of the law in which we lay down and they act outside
(24:47) of that. Therefore, they commit emolment violations. They're stealing from us,
(24:53) from the public that they're getting paid by to do something we didn't tell
(24:58) them to do or didn't give them authority to do. That's what an emolement
(25:04) violation is. I also proved that judges and
(25:09) prosecutors get a net retention or a commission for finding someone
(25:14) guilty. A commission. And I also prove that they share that with the defense
(25:20) attorney
(25:26) for a guilty verdict. Now, what is a guilty
(25:35) verdict? What is a guilty verdict? What do they do when they arraign
(25:40) you? They want you to plead guilty or not guilty. Really? Did you know those are
(25:47) both commercial terms? Guilty and not guilty is both commercial terms. Did you know that in
(25:55) on property on land, industrial, commercial, and residential are all
(26:00) commercial terms? Who owns a house? No, you don't.
(26:09) You don't really own You don't own your house. The state owns your house. They can do anything they want with it. You
(26:14) know why? because the county came along with a bunch of people who were compartmentalized legal
(26:20) idiots and they stole your property on behalf of the state from you and you
(26:28) didn't correct the errors so therefore you acquanced was telling you about Ken
(26:35) Cromer his house was foreclosed on by the court kicked out of his house he
(26:41) lived with somebody else that through the mercy of someone else he lived Him and his wife lived for 10 months
(26:47) somewhere else and I got him back into his house. How did I do
(26:55) that? I helped him get his land back in land under the original land
(27:01) patent and accept the grant deed. And no government can deny that or kick you out
(27:08) of your home if you own your property. It's called a superior title.
(27:15) superior title. How do you get your superior title? What's that? How do you
(27:21) get your superior title? That's later on in the class.
(27:27) Okay. See, most people have a warranty deed. And a warranty deed is called an
(27:33) abstract of title. I used to own 20% of a title company. And I didn't know this when I
(27:40) owned it. Yeah. Had a real estate company, two
(27:45) mortgage companies, a building supply company, three development companies, a construction company with 96 employees.
(27:53) I had a specialty building supply company at one time. I was doing pretty
(27:59) well. And I didn't know all this. So they took it away from me. Took everything away from me.
(28:08) Sure. Sure. Did you know all mortgages in the United States are fraud?
(28:14) Every one of them. Everyone is fraud. Did you know your mortgage was paid off?
(28:23) Your mortgage was paid off the moment you signed the mortgage application and
(28:28) they accepted it. You know who paid it off? You
(28:35) did. See, you're not a debtor. You're a creditor. You just don't know it.
(28:41) You don't know it. They want you to think you're a debtor and that you're
(28:47) indebted to them. Your signature paid off that loan
(28:53) immediately. And you don't know why, do you? Okay. I'm going to teach you guys why. I'm giving you What I'm doing right
(28:59) here is I'm It's called a tease. I'm teasing you with a lot of little things that we're going to cover later in
(29:05) depth. Okay? But I'm trying to wake you up right
(29:10) now. Wake you up to things you don't know. But you can go through this whole
(29:17) thing and it's case law, Supreme case law, everything of why you don't need a
(29:22) driver's license to drive. Okay. Now, there are three cases where you do need a driver's license.
(29:29) When you're hauling passengers for hire. Are you an Uber driver,
(29:35) Lift driver, a taxi driver, a bus driver? You need a driver's license. Are
(29:40) you hauling goods or services for interstate commerce? A truck driver, you
(29:46) need a driver's license. Are you a public servant in the performance of your public duties? A cop, a fireman,
(29:54) driving a fire truck, whatever. An ambulance driver, you need a driver's
(29:59) license. But if you're just getting up in the morning, leaving your house, going to the store, going to work, going
(30:05) to a movie, coming home, doing whatever it is you do, you're in your private
(30:12) business affairs. You don't need a driver's license. That's a title. What about a
(30:19) title? You don't own your car. You don't own a car. Have the title. No, you don't. You have a certificate of title.
(30:28) You don't own your car either. The state owns it. See, here's the thing.
(30:35) All right, let's tell you a little story. I happen to like Chevy crew cab long bed Duramax diesel trucks because I
(30:41) like farming and ranching. Okay. Show us how to own our car, right? If I walk
(30:47) into a Chevy dealership, it's called an automobile dealership, right? It's not
(30:52) called a motor vehicle dealership because it's not a motor vehicle when they sell it to you. It
(30:58) only becomes a motor vehicle when you title license and register it. Before that, it's an automobile.
(31:06) It's private. Who was our first car insurance company in the United States? It was called travelers
(31:13) insurance. It was designed for travelers. That's what we are. We're travelers. We travel from point A to
(31:20) point B. And there are private business affairs 99% of the time. Okay. You walk
(31:26) into an automobile dealership, if I laid out $75,000 cash for a brand new crew
(31:32) cab Duramax diesel pickup, and you might be 80 by now, at that moment in time, I own that
(31:41) truck, but the minute the salesman looks at me and says, "I need another $250 for
(31:46) title, license, and registration, please." And I give them another
(31:51) $250 instead of that stack of 75,000. That's the moment I gifted that pickup
(31:59) to the state. So what I do is I look at them and I say, "No, that's not necessary.
(32:06) I'm going to export it to a foreign country." And then when I get in and I
(32:12) turn the key and I drive it off of their lot, I'm driving it out of the state of
(32:19) Oregon into Oregon. I just exported it into a foreign nation.
(32:26) Yeah. Manufacturer statement of origin is in that little envelope that comes with your truck. When you pay the
(32:33) $250, he removes that. He fills it out. He sends it to the state. He sent the
(32:38) state the title and you get a certificate. A certificate means there's a title out there somewhere. But you
(32:45) don't have it. You don't have it. You don't own these cars. How does that work if you
(32:51) get pulled over? If you own your car, they can't do anything to you. Yeah, but
(32:56) you don't have a license plate. Wait, by the time we're into this three-day thing, you're going to be blown away.
(33:03) I'm telling you. Okay. See, the reason I talk so much about
(33:10) driving and and automobiles is because that's usually the first place any one
(33:15) of us gets into trouble in our life. we get a ticket or something else, but it's
(33:22) usually associated with driving or operating a motor vehicle by a person, a
(33:29) citizen or a resident. So, what is the legal definition of the word citizen?
(33:38) City is municipal. Zen is
(33:43) servant. A municipal servant. Isn't that what our public servants
(33:50) are? We're calling oursel the same thing. We're calling our public servants. We're We just became We've
(33:57) registered with the Department of Human Resources with the HR Department of the
(34:03) State of By the way, where's the state of Utah located?
(34:08) Washington DC. 44 Northwest Congress Avenue, Washington DC. Okay.
(34:15) It's not even in Utah. Utah is a foreign nation to the state of
(34:22) Utah. What about the city of Riverton? That's a subsidiary of the county of
(34:29) Salt Lake. Salt Lake County, which is a subsidiary to the state of
(34:34) Utah. They're all private for-profit entities. Bill Clinton revealed that to
(34:41) everybody. He sold off all of government. Everything is a private for-profit
(34:46) entity. Everything that wasn't already previously sold off, which was most of it to begin with. He sold off what was
(34:54) left. A private for-profit entity. It has a Dun and Brad Street number. Do
(35:00) anybody know what Dun and Brad Street is? It's a credit reporting agency for
(35:05) corporations, right? So, if they've got a Dun and Brad Street number, that means they're a corporation.
(35:12) Right? What does the Supreme Court say? Says, "Since governments have chosen to incorporate, they must follow the same
(35:19) rules as any other corporation." Well, wait a minute. Can a guy wearing a Walmart
(35:27) shirt, little blue shirt, come into your house, kick your door down, and steal your
(35:33) kids? What would you do? Well, wait a minute. City of Riverton
(35:40) Police is a private for-profit entity, a corporation with the Dun and Brad Street
(35:46) number. They're no different than Walmart. They operate through the
(35:52) consent of the government. They have to get your tacid agreement that you're a
(35:58) citizen or person or resident. What is the legal definition of the word person? An entity or a
(36:05) vessel? An entity or a vessel. What is the legal definition of the word resident? Someone there temporarily to
(36:12) do business. What's your zip code, Jody?
(36:21) By writing that on the letter to your grandmother.
(36:26) By writing your zip code on the letter to your grandmother, you just told the United
(36:33) States Postal Service. And what are our courts? Post offices. See, I already
(36:38) teased you with that, right? They're banks and post offices.
(36:43) So, by writing this on the letter to your grandmother, you just told the postal service, our court
(36:53) system, that you'll inhabit, that you live in Washington,
(36:59) DC, and that you just reside in Riverton temporarily to do business.
(37:08) So there's 337 million people in the United States who live in Washington DC
(37:13) and about 40,000 state nationals who live in the rest of the
(37:19) states. But you just guys just move in temporarily to do business all around
(37:24) us. How do you feel about that? Huh?
(37:31) It's the truth. But you write a letter as to put brackets around the zip code.
(37:36) Ah why why do you put brackets around the zip code? Put it back where it belongs. No to remove it from the
(37:42) contract. It's called the boxing rule.
(37:48) Brackets would be the equivalent four corners. The four corners rule. The boxing rule. Brackets have four corners.
(37:57) Five years ago, I was made an ambassador for the voice of youth
(38:04) program. Uh, voice of youth was a part of the world benefit church. The world
(38:10) benefit church was put in to place for one reason and one reason only. not to
(38:16) have a congregation and preach the gospel, but to educate world leaders
(38:23) on God's laws, on what's right and what's wrong. It's the only reason they
(38:29) they were put into place. The voice of youth program was put into place to be
(38:35) the voice of people who couldn't speak for themselves, our minors. What is the legal definition of
(38:43) the word minor? It's someone under the age of 18, right?
(38:48) We all know that part of it. Or this part, we don't know. Someone of any age
(38:55) who hasn't claimed their minor estate. Have you claimed your minor estate? You're a minor. Have you? Have
(39:03) you? Did you even know you had a minor estate? What if I told you you were
(39:09) worth millions of dollars and you didn't even know it? And what if I could prove it to
(39:15) you? And that you have a trust fund and you're all trust fund babies. And that
(39:22) trust fund is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And so when you sign that
(39:28) mortgage, they borrowed out of your trust fund and paid it off. And then you just keep paying it
(39:34) back and paying it back and paying it back. Why is that?
(39:40) Five years ago as ambassador of voice of youth, I gave a speech at the
(39:47) Hague and I told our world leaders the story of a mother.
(39:55) and the story of a mother. I was told afterwards from just about everybody
(40:01) that this is the mo most important story that should be told every man, woman,
(40:06) and child on earth, but that they don't want me to tell it. You never tell me not to do
(40:14) something that's right because then I'm going to tell it over and over and over again. Amen.
(40:23) Okay. a mother nine months pregnant. Pay close attention to this guys. Telling
(40:29) you, it's important for your life, your children's lives, your grandchildren's
(40:36) lives for generations to come. But a mother nine months pregnant
(40:42) walks into a foundling hospital. What is the legal definition of the word
(40:48) foundling? It's a safe place to abandon a child. Did you know all
(40:54) churches, all hospitals, all police stations, and all fire stations in the
(40:59) United States are designated as foundling by Congress.
(41:07) You can take a baby and put it in a basket and walk into any of those four
(41:12) locations and set that basket down on the floor and smile and wave and walk
(41:18) out without any consequences to yourself
(41:24) whatsoever. Can you even imagine that that you can abandon a
(41:29) child? But they designated those places as family hospitals. Did they tell you
(41:37) on a brass plaque somewhere in an obscure location inside the hospital,
(41:42) probably under a stairwell, it says this hospital is a founding hospital. Found found
(41:51) lean hospital. So, a mother nine months pregnant walks into a family hospital.
(41:57) She goes through a major medical procedure called childbirth where she's in pain and under duress.
(42:07) She's probably under the influence of painkillers of some
(42:13) type. You got to be pretty tough to give birth. I wouldn't want to do
(42:19) it.
(42:24) Anyway, she has that beautiful baby and all she's thinking about is getting home with it and leaving. But see the baby in
(42:33) history throughout history came out of the water was tugged through the birth canal was docked at the dock by the dock
(42:40) tender where a bill of ladyading was filled out and received on the cargo where its soul was taken its soul plates
(42:49) the footprints of the baby. The placenta was
(42:54) taken. Okay. They took the baby's soul. Then they sent it out with a tug and is
(43:00) presumed dead and lost at sea until it should return and claim its minor
(43:09) estate. No physician delivers a baby. Only a doctor does. Doctor is dock
(43:17) tender. The baby is a vessel, a ship. That's where the all
(43:22) caps name comes in. If you look at the names of ships are in all capital letters,
(43:29) okay, no one disclosed the terms and conditions of the contract yet. You were handed a
(43:36) stack of papers to fill out and you were only told, and this was right out of the nurse's manual, this is just to register
(43:43) your baby with the state and to give it a name. and you fill out the
(43:49) paperwork and you name your baby and you sign as an
(43:55) informant. What is the legal definition of the word informant? Someone who gives someone
(44:01) else up to another thereby giving the title and equity of your child to the
(44:07) state. This creates a doctrine called parents patray. Guess I should write that.
(44:24) It's Latin for state is your parent state is the
(44:31) parent creates a doctrine of parents patri through this doctrine that's how
(44:37) they have control over you and through your consent of being a citizen a person
(44:42) or resident three things you never want to I hope the chair is not too comfortable.
(44:48) I want I don't want to see you doing that now. All right, I'll throw something at you. Anyway,
(44:55) uh the doctrine of parents
(45:01) patray. So, no terms and conditions of the sales contract were given. No full
(45:07) and honest disclosure of the contract. No two wedding signatures.
(45:12) No one there was securities licensed, insurance licensed, no
(45:18) perspectus was given. If you go to your stock broker and you want to invest in a corporation, you he is required by law
(45:25) to give you a perspectus, right? And you weren't given
(45:31) one. What I'm trying to teach you here is it was all done through fraud without any full honest disclosure of the
(45:39) contract. You were licensed, bonded,
(45:45) insured. Your vessel was created. A susta QB trust was
(46:01) created. A cest trust is an individual trust underneath the umbrella of the
(46:09) public charitable trust.
(46:15) So the public charitable trust act of 1882 created a public charitable
(46:20) trust. The cestuvie trust act created the cestuvie trust. Each individual
(46:26) trust that you all have through your birth certificate and registration. On your birth certificate there's a bank
(46:31) name. It's on bond paper. There's a cuspup number
(46:36) cusip number. What is a CUSEP number? It's an
(46:44) investment control number that's regulated by the Securities and Exchange
(46:52) Commission. If you were born between 1933 and 1975, you were bonded for
(46:59) $630,000 and insured for 1 million. If you were born after
(47:06) 1975, you were bonded for 1 million and insured for two.
(47:15) Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's just the initial investment. It's initial upfront investment. You were a
(47:23) few days old, right? So, like me, I was born on April 20th on 420.
(47:31) Nice. I knew there would be one in the
(47:38) crowd. And my vessel was created on
(47:44) 53. Two different dates, two different events. My vessel was born on May the
(47:51) 3rd. I was born on April 20th. For that period of
(47:57) time, I was a state national. In fact, I was a
(48:03) Californian. I was born in California and I was a state national. I
(48:08) was a free independent one of we the people for that
(48:15) long. And then I got registered and I became a citizen, a
(48:21) person and resident. And I lost all my diplomatic
(48:26) immunity. I lost it all. I became a servant, a
(48:33) slave. See, the 13th amendment, the Constitution freed the black slaves. In the 14th Amendment, the Constitution
(48:39) made all of us slaves. See, there's a maximum law that says that in which one creates, one
(48:49) controls. God created me and he controlled me. And then
(48:55) unknowingly while under duress without any full and honest disclosure of the terms and conditions of the contract
(49:02) with no one even license to explain it available. My mother
(49:09) warded you to the state warded me to the state in a birth ward. I became a ward
(49:15) of the state. Why do you think a birthing ward is called a ward?
(49:20) I became a ward of the state. a war to the court under the doctrine of parents
(49:26) patray. I became a slave and I didn't even know it. I grew
(49:32) up thinking I was free. I fought for this country. I thought I was free. I got shot. I thought I was doing it for
(49:38) the right reasons. Thought I was free. Now I teach veterans how to get rid of PTSD and I can do it in 20 minutes. I
(49:46) know guys that have been going to psychologists for years and taking drugs for years trying to get rid of their
(49:52) PTSD and it destroys their wives and their families and themselves and I can
(49:57) solve it in 20 minutes. Yes, please. How I explain a a little something
(50:04) that's off track. So would you do me a favor? Get tell remind me to tell you.
(50:10) Okay. It's very important. All right.
(50:16) What happens? What happens at our birth with the Cesta QV? First of all,
(50:23) we have a PCT, public charitable trust, an umbrella. There's 337 million little
(50:32) CQVS, CESQV trusts, one for each of us, right in this country.
(50:41) Say that one more time. CQV. Yeah. Every individual in the
(50:46) United States and in most countries of the world have assessed a QV trust. And
(50:51) we have this CQB. And here's what happens. And this is incredibly important. You all know
(50:58) basic accounting. What is that? It's a balance sheet,
(51:05) right? A balance sheet. It's got debits and credits.
(51:12) You guys have been thinking you're the debtor. They keep telling us that, right? We're in debt. We're a debtor. We
(51:18) owe money on credit cards. We owe money on our houses. We owe money on everything. What happens at birth,
(51:25) though, and what I'm just going to use the figures from 75 to now because it's
(51:31) round numbers. We were bonded for $1
(51:37) million. What does that mean? That means the bank went to the
(51:42) International Monetary Fund and the bank on behalf of the public under your cusup
(51:50) number borrowed from the International Monetary Fund $1
(51:55) million in ones, fives, tens, 20s, 50s, hundreds, and they threw it out there
(52:01) into the general public. They distributed that $1 million to the bank for every person who's born. That's what
(52:07) they do. On the credit side, $1 million worth of United States
(52:13) Treasury bonds are issued and they're
(52:19) sold. They're hypothecated. They are bundled and they are sold on the stock
(52:27) exchange. And if we wanted to, I could pull up a website if we had internet
(52:32) access and I could put in one of your CUSP numbers.
(52:37) And I could show you the companies that are buying and selling you today. You have more than one cusup number. By the
(52:44) way, as we increase in value, I'll just put it
(52:49) that way. As we get better in our life, the more we join the military or get
(52:56) more college degrees, we get more and more acusup numbers. You are the credit.
(53:02) You are the creditor. They're making you believe you're also the debtor. And you are.
(53:09) You're both. This is your vessel. This is you. Okay? This is your labor. This is
(53:18) your worth. I got five college
(53:24) degrees. Every time I got an advanced degree in college, I got a new CUSIP number. Was in the military. I got a new
(53:31) CUIP number. All these cusp numbers are attached to my main birth number.
(53:37) Okay, this is in a bad spot. Anyway, let's stop here. It's a balance
(53:45) sheet, right? It's balanced. It's got a million on one side, a million on the other. This gets invested. It keeps
(53:51) growing and growing and growing. And let's just say it grows to a hundred million dollars. And by the way, that figure is
(53:59) low. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. Really, I've seen individuals
(54:04) worth 35 billion or more that didn't know they had a dime.
(54:10) Okay? It keeps growing and growing and growing. Our first 18 years of life,
(54:16) we're not spending anything. So, nothing is going over here. Our first 18 years,
(54:22) that's growing and growing and growing for 18 years. And it's being hypothecated and traded. And they've
(54:27) done a good job of managing it. They really have. first 18 years it's growing and growing and growing. You're not
(54:33) spending anything. You're not adding anything to the debit side. Then you go get a job and you get married and you go
(54:39) out and you buy a house. I'm just going to use numbers. And the numbers themselves don't matter. It's the
(54:45) concept. Okay? You buy a car or two. You buy some utilities or two over
(54:52) your lifetime, some medical bills, some food, whatever. They keep track of it
(54:57) all through your tax returns, your credit card, your bank statements. Banking is all tied into the IMF, the
(55:05) Federal Reserve. We got a big buildings of bean counters called the Department of Fiscal
(55:11) Services and they those accountants just keep track of everything, everybody's
(55:18) life. And this all starts to add up on the debit side. And this just keeps
(55:24) growing and growing and growing. On the investment side, at some point in time, you die and it goes through probate.
(55:31) They take some of this and let's just say over your lifetime, you've spent, I'm going to round it off to $10
(55:37) million. So, they subtract 10 million out of your investment and they
(55:44) pay off all this and it becomes a zero balance. They even pay back the initial loan to the International Monetary Fund
(55:51) plus interest. That was a loan from a foreign entity by the
(55:57) way to the public charitable trust and they pay it back. The balance is zero.
(56:04) Now this has let's just say for this
(56:10) discussion has $90 million left in it. What happens to it?
(56:17) The Cesta QB trust lives on in perpetuity forever. So it keeps going.
(56:24) Everyone who has ever died since 1933 is currently funding government.
(56:31) This money gets reinvested. They can't take this, but the
(56:36) balance must stay the same forever. But if it keeps earning, they
(56:44) just sweep it off the top and it funds government. It's called
(56:50) offbook funds. G in the states it's GSA and in
(56:56) the federal government it's CQV and it continues to fund government. Why
(57:03) do you think they don't care if they spend $3 trillion on foreign entities?
(57:09) Because it's not their money. It came out of your trusts. It's not part of
(57:14) taxes. In fact, if you took the entire federal budget, how much is derived from
(57:20) taxes and tariffs?
(57:30) If you call up the Department of Fiscal Services and you send a foyer request and you ask them who is the
(57:38) largest contributor to the federal budget, the
(57:45) Department of Justice to the tune of $1 trillion
(57:51) dollar a day. is taken out of our cest trusts or our
(57:57) court systems every day. A trillion dollars. That's more in 25 days than our
(58:03) entire gross domestic product in a year. In 25 days, they don't have to
(58:09) disclose the CQB. See, I had to prove this in federal
(58:15) court to get to talk about it. So a big portion of this comes out of
(58:24) this before we die. Every time you have a court case,
(58:32) the case is a cusup number. The case number, the court clerk is the banker.
(58:40) Mary at the ninth district of federal court. I showed how upon indictment, now
(58:48) when someone gets indicted, are they found guilty? No. No, they're not found guilty. They
(58:54) haven't even been tried. But upon
(59:08) indictment upon indictment, Mary
(59:14) filled out the SF273
(59:20) form with the Department of Fiscal Services, which is called a bid bond
(59:28) form. She told the Department of Fiscal
(59:33) Services with this form to begin liquidation of this person's account
(59:41) because we're going to need some of it. You got to remember they're in US
(59:46) Treasury bonds. They're not liquid capital. They have to be sold off. That
(59:51) takes a little bit of time, right? So, she filled out that form in
(59:56) this particular case in October. The trial was set for
(1:00:02) January. Didn't happen until April.
(1:00:09) Upon the day of the trial, the exact day of the trial, Mary filled out the
(1:00:16) SF 274 form with the Department of Fiscal
(1:00:22) Services, which is called a performance bond, telling the Department of Fiscal
(1:00:29) Services that this person has been found guilty and they will have to perform.
(1:00:37) That's what a performance bond is. It's notifying someone that that you're going
(1:00:43) to have to perform.
(1:00:48) Okay. This was supposed to take place July 13th. I pushed it to August
(1:00:57) 30th. Mary filled out the
(1:01:03) SF275 form. which is the payment form. It's no
(1:01:09) different than a wire transfer order is would have told the department
(1:01:15) of fiscal services to wire transfer that money to the court. Now what money am I
(1:01:22) talking about? The amount the penal
(1:01:28) sum. So, an indictment. An
(1:01:34) indictment is a bill. True
(1:01:39) bill. If you don't pay the bill, you're brought up on charges. You're tried for those charges.
(1:01:45) This particular case, the woman, the grandmother, had four felony counts of
(1:01:52) fraud. Each had a penal sum. Each count had a penal sum of $2
(1:02:01) million. That's 8 million total. In addition to that 8
(1:02:09) million, the judge was going to receive 95,000 in what they call net
(1:02:20) retention and the prosecutor 50,000 per
(1:02:27) count. Four counts. That's wrong. Oh no. because they share
(1:02:33) that with the defense attorney that she had that she paid 27,000 out of her
(1:02:39) pocket to represent her. So, what is the legal definition of
(1:02:46) the word attorney? Anybody know? Not the ones that have watched my class.
(1:02:54) Got to watch him. An actor to attorney. The legal
(1:03:01) definition of the word actor is someone who gets up on stage and lies convincingly enough to make you believe
(1:03:08) in the character and the plot. Therefore, a liar. What is to a
(1:03:15) turnar to steal from one and turn over to another. So by the very definition of
(1:03:21) their profession, they're liars and thieves. See, God only warned us about four professions in the Bible. Do you
(1:03:28) know what they were? attorneys, bankers, attorneys, tax collectors, doctors,
(1:03:38) police, and organized religion. Why did he warn us about organized
(1:03:43) religion? Joseph Smith warned the Mormon church about organized
(1:03:49) religion. He said that someday in the future it would be corrupted by
(1:03:55) men. He said that. In fact, he says, "I doubt it will last 75 to 100
(1:04:02) years." And he was right. How many people are not brought up LDS in this
(1:04:07) room? Just a couple. Okay. It's all right. I'm going to talk talk to you
(1:04:13) about the church. I grew up
(1:04:18) LDS. In fact, my mother was born in Lehi in a one room log cabin with a dirt
(1:04:25) pour on the Indian reservation. Well, her dad taught English to the Indians
(1:04:30) here in 1917. My dad in the 50s, right after he
(1:04:38) got out of the war in World War II, he was on a Navy in the USS Texas. He ran
(1:04:44) the church welfare ranches. He was head of all the church welfare
(1:04:49) ranches. My family has a long history here. Um, the
(1:04:56) Bennett were the contractors for Brigham Young. They built Brigham Young's house.
(1:05:04) David Bennett's name is on the church of Bear Lake. That's my grandfather on my mom's side. My
(1:05:11) grandmother was born somewhere in Nebraska along the Plat River in the back of a wagon on their way
(1:05:19) here. Okay. So I printed off DNC98. What is the
(1:05:26) doctrine and covenants? Doctrine is the laws the churches to live by. Covenant
(1:05:33) is a promise to live by those laws. It's why it's called a doctrine and a covenant. They promise to live by these
(1:05:41) laws. 98. Just going to read a little bit. And
(1:05:47) my eyes are bad. So, and the writing is small.
(1:05:54) I'm going to start with uh verse three. Therefore, he giveth
(1:05:59) this promise unto you with an immutable covenant, that it shall be fulfilled, and all things wherewith you have been
(1:06:06) afflicted shall work together for your good, and to my name's glory, sayeth the Lord. And now, verily, I say unto you,
(1:06:13) concerning the laws of the land, it is my will that my people should observe to
(1:06:19) do all things. whatsoever I command them, that the law of the land, which is
(1:06:27) constitutional, supporting the principles of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all
(1:06:34) mankind, and is justifiable before
(1:06:40) me. And then it moves on. Therefore, I the Lord justify you
(1:06:46) and your brethren of my church in befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land. He says,
(1:06:52) make it your friend, the constitutions. That's our supreme
(1:07:00) law. And as pertaining to the law of man, whatsoever is more or less than
(1:07:08) this cometh of evil. I the Lord God made you free, therefore
(1:07:14) you are free indeed, and the law also maketh you free. Nevertheless, when the
(1:07:20) wicked rule, the people mourn. Wherefore honest men and wise men should be sought
(1:07:26) diligently, and good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold. Otherwise, whatsoever is less than this cometh of
(1:07:35) evil. Rules, codes, statutes, and ordinances are not law. What is the
(1:07:40) legal definition of the word legal? This is going to just kick your
(1:07:47) butts when I tell you what the definition of the word legal is. It is the undoing of God's law.
(1:07:58) What is legal is not lawful and what is lawful is not legal.
(1:08:10) Let that sink in for just a second. What is legal is the undoing of
(1:08:16) God's laws. All throughout the Bible, God taught us a lot of things. And I studied
(1:08:22) the Bible very, very well for a lot of years. And I went to every religion on
(1:08:28) earth that I could go to. I've been to China. I've sat with the Buddhists. I've been all over this
(1:08:35) world. When I was in intelligence with the government, when they had something
(1:08:41) that dealt with religion, they sent me.
(1:08:46) They sent me into the basement of the Vatican with a group of people to look
(1:08:52) at the lost scrolls. And we brought out the United States
(1:08:57) government, brought out of the basement, the Mcabes, Esther, the wisdom of Solomon,
(1:09:03) many books of the Bible that weren't in the Bible. Okay? And there's many more down
(1:09:10) there. Many more. The the Catholic Church suppressed us like you wouldn't
(1:09:16) believe. They kept so many things hidden from us. There are books of the Bible that reveal exactly what is happening in
(1:09:23) this world today. and we recorded it and we know what it
(1:09:32) is. And uh anyway, I'll go into some more off
(1:09:39) camera, but what I'm trying to tell you, I quit going to church 20 years
(1:09:48) ago. Doesn't mean I don't believe in the basic core teachings of this church. I
(1:09:53) do. I think they're the best family oriented, most common sense church on
(1:10:00) the face of the planet. But I also know, just like Joseph Smith knew, that men would
(1:10:06) corrupt it at the highest levels. Exactly. Exactly. And all you have to do
(1:10:12) is ask yourself, who of the prophet and the twel apostles are lawyers?
(1:10:24) That's all you have to ask. Okay.
(1:10:31) When I gave that talk in church, I was removed from the stand, hauled to the
(1:10:37) bishop's office, talked to, and I never went
(1:10:44) back. Okay. That's right.
(1:10:51) That's right. Tell an attorney that statutes aren't law. That what's legal
(1:10:57) is the undoing of God's laws. He He never learned that in law
(1:11:02) school. So they base everything on a penal sum. No matter what crime it is you
(1:11:07) have, it's commercial. All crimes are
(1:11:14) commercial. So they get paid a net retention. Our Department of Justice collects the majority of our federal
(1:11:20) budget through our cus numbers out of our
(1:11:34) susta program. the federal court clerks. If you look at
(1:11:39) Portland, Oregon's building that pretty much Antifa destroyed the federal courthouse in Portland, but it's a
(1:11:46) fivestory building with two more stories below ground.
(1:11:53) Okay. Judge Mosman, he he's no longer there, but he had the top four, him and
(1:12:01) his aids. US Marshall Service has a bottom floor
(1:12:07) down the basement. That's the Marshalss. Then there's two more floors
(1:12:14) of judges and courtrooms. Two floors. All the rest of this building
(1:12:19) are court quirks. Court quirks. Why do they need
(1:12:25) hundreds? I mean, they're in cubicles. Why do they need This building covers an entire city
(1:12:31) block. It's a big building. Why do they need so many court clerks? They're like
(1:12:36) tellers. They're bank tellers. Mary, the head court clerk,
(1:12:43) Mary runs all the tellers. She's the bank president. She handles all the bonds.
(1:12:49) The federal courts buy all the state bonds. So everything that happens in the ninth district which is California,
(1:12:58) Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Idaho,
(1:13:04) Montana, anything that happens in any of those state courts under the GSAs, the federal government buys them.
(1:13:12) The federal court buys them from the states. That's what funds the
(1:13:17) states and then they collect out of our trusts through the Department of Fiscal
(1:13:23) Services. So those people are sitting there in their cubicles typing on the
(1:13:29) computer and they're filling out the SF273, 274, and 275 forms all day long
(1:13:38) for Yeah. It's a bank. So when these uh blue and white lights
(1:13:44) come on behind you and you got that policy enforcement revenue collection agent behind
(1:13:51) you who the Supreme Court says has no obligation to protect you. No, it's not
(1:13:57) their duty. It is not the police officer's duty to protect you. Their job title is a policy revenue collection
(1:14:04) agent. They're they're to help fund the counties and the cities and the state. They presume you're a citizen or person
(1:14:11) or resident. Your status. This is called status. Anybody
(1:14:17) know what status is? Did you know there was more than
(1:14:23) one? Geez. They just didn't want you to know this crap, do they? See, in title 8, section 1101 of the United States
(1:14:31) Code, it it says definitions of
(1:14:37) statuses. These are the definitions of status that the United States government
(1:14:43) accepts, right? You can be a US citizen or a US national or state citizen or a
(1:14:48) state national or a variety of other things that they accept.
(1:14:55) But what are you taught? Just to be the one that they have control
(1:15:01) over. Isn't that crazy? It is status. They presume your status. This
(1:15:07) government works off of
(1:15:13) unrebuted presumption. Unrebuted presumption.
(1:15:21) They steal your house by making a lot of clerical errors and you don't correct them and you
(1:15:26) acquance. You just pay the bills and you don't correct those errors
(1:15:31) and they stole it from you on behalf of the state. They steal your car when you go to the
(1:15:38) dealership and buy one by making a
(1:15:43) statement with a clerical errors that you fill out, you sign, you consent to,
(1:15:48) and then they stole your car and you didn't even know it. You
(1:15:54) come home, you tell your family, "Look at my new car.
(1:15:59) Smell good. Smell." Got that new car smell so nice. It's the states. You
(1:16:06) don't have the MSO or the MCO. Now, they assume you did something
(1:16:13) wrong. You did 70 and a 55. Doesn't matter what it is. They
(1:16:20) assume you did something wrong. They get your tacid agreement of you being a citizen, a person, a
(1:16:25) resident, and then they get up on stand and they
(1:16:31) lie. and your attorney sits there and says, "Shh, don't say anything. We'll
(1:16:38) get our chance later." And then the hammer gets dropped and every lie that they said became truth and fact upon the
(1:16:47) record. You acquance to it and your attorney knew that.
(1:16:52) He knows he's supposed to object to everything they say and he sat there and he was quiet and he told you not to
(1:16:59) speak because you can't. They can't hear you anyway. You know a judge can't hear you in court.
(1:17:06) No, they summons you into court. What is a summon? It's a seance. They're wearing
(1:17:11) black robes. This is a satanic ritual. They summon you into court. A seance
(1:17:17) calling the dead into court. And there's two ways for you to appear in court.
(1:17:22) There's only two. It's in the law. There's general appearance. That's where you just show up
(1:17:30) generally and you ex you accept jurisdiction by just showing
(1:17:37) up. I get your tacit agreement of you being a citizen personal resident. You just show
(1:17:42) up. They call the dead into court and there you are. They call out your all caps name and you don't say, "No, that's
(1:17:50) not me, your honor. That's my vessel. I take
(1:17:55) ownership of that vessel. I claim the minor estate. You don't say any of that. First words out of your mouth in a
(1:18:02) courtroom should be what? Okay. I'm sitting down in the back row.
(1:18:09) Judge walks in. Bailiff says, "All rise." I lean back on my chair and I put my feet
(1:18:16) up. I sure ain't going to stand when he walks in. That's giving him
(1:18:22) jurisdiction. When an employee walks into the room, does this boss stand? No.
(1:18:28) He's my public servant. I have to take control of the court immediately. He's If you stand, you're
(1:18:37) the employee. He's the boss. He's getting your tacid agreement. You're turning over
(1:18:42) jurisdiction to him. Uh, were you in Logan at the at Cody's
(1:18:51) deal where we had about 60 people there? Okay. We had about 60 people in Cody
(1:18:56) Smith's court case in Logan, Utah. And I met with everybody before we
(1:19:01) went and I told them, not only do not stand when the judge walks in, but I
(1:19:07) want you to make a concerted effort to lean back and put your feet up.
(1:19:15) And they did. There was only one reporter on the other side that stood
(1:19:21) up. Nobody else did. And then in one voice when they
(1:19:29) started running over the top of Cody, we all said, "Let him
(1:19:35) speak in one
(1:19:41) voice." and Cody got to speak. The entire court changed. What I tell people
(1:19:48) is rally the troops. Get them in there on your behalf. If you can get at least
(1:19:54) 25 people in the audience doing what I've just telling you to do, when you stand up up there, say, "I'm here by
(1:20:03) special divine appearance, your honor, to call for a constitutional
(1:20:09) court of record, and I brought a grand jury with me
(1:20:15) of my peers." What is the definition of peers?
(1:20:22) likeminded individuals. No, here's one that's really got screwed up by our bar
(1:20:29) association. When you call for a jury trial or a trial by jury, what's the
(1:20:35) difference? Do you guys know? Always call for a trial by
(1:20:40) jury. Why call for a trial by jury? trial by jury would not be
(1:20:48) the Yeah, but the trial by jury, the jury decides your fate, a jury trial, the judge can
(1:20:56) override the jury's decision and do whatever he wants and they will try and force you into a jury
(1:21:03) trial. They will.
(1:21:08) Now, here's a definition twist on the word peers.
(1:21:13) The definition of the word peers is someone from your own neighborhood who
(1:21:20) knows your character and your situation in life. For only then can you truly
(1:21:26) judge a man. What do they get? They question the jury because they
(1:21:32) don't want anybody that even knows you. They want people from other counties, other areas of the state.
(1:21:40) They want to rig the trial to railroad
(1:21:47) you. To railroad is to lead somebody down a narrow path or rail to a predetermined outlook or conclusion. And
(1:21:55) that's the path. Did that make any sense
(1:22:03) yet? Oh, the fraud in which we perceive, right? It's ridiculous. And when you
(1:22:10) stand up from that back row when they call your name and the very first words out of your mouth when you stand up and
(1:22:15) you take your first step is I'm here by special divine appearance judge to settle this matter to call for a
(1:22:22) constitutional court of record to ask for a summary judgment upon the truth and facts placed upon this record by my
(1:22:29) documents and I stand firmly upon my rights. Can I get that summary judgement
(1:22:35) your honor? this thing is over with. They can't give
(1:22:40) you they have to to do a summary judgement. The rule of
(1:22:50) three rule of three applies applies in all things celestial, terrestrial, and
(1:22:57) tstal. Right? There's a rule of three. You have to ask them three times.
(1:23:07) And if they have an important question, they're supposed to ask you three times. And if
(1:23:13) not, you can say, "What did you say again?" See,
(1:23:20) how does a judge derive their authority? since you brought it up.
(1:23:31) number one from his oath.
(1:23:37) Oath of office can't
(1:23:45) write and any other
(1:23:51) requirements by the
(1:23:59) state to hold office. His oath and any other requirements by the state to hold
(1:24:05) office. That's how he derives his authority. Second, he deres his authority
(1:24:13) by statute. What did I say a minute ago?
(1:24:19) It's the worst looking e I've ever seen in my life.
(1:24:28) The rules, codes, statutes, and ordinances are not law.
(1:24:33) Third, he derives his authority through parents
(1:24:43) patre. See my first three questions, the very first document I submit if we have
(1:24:50) to go to court is a notice of appearance. A notice of
(1:24:57) appearance. I'm gonna say, "Hey, I received this seance in the mail where
(1:25:04) you're calling the dead entity into court, and I'm willing to appear to settle this matter, but I'm going to do
(1:25:11) it by special divine appearance as a living
(1:25:17) soul." See, what does Genesis 2:7 say?
(1:25:23) Bible scholars in this room, I see that. Genesis 2:7 says, I'm not trying to give
(1:25:29) you a hard time. It's just kind of fun. But, uh, and I, God, created man, from the
(1:25:34) dust of the earth, and I breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. Are we man, or are
(1:25:42) we living souls? We're living souls. Our bodies are made up of what?
(1:25:50) Energy. The dust of the earth. And they're held together by energy. the energy of our soul, the
(1:25:57) celestial, testral, and terrestrial souls, which by the way, they're here
(1:26:03) helping us right now in a big way.
(1:26:12) Exactly. I'm just here to settle this matter as the executive to the trust. So
(1:26:19) therefore, it's not Yeah.
(1:26:25) that vessel that they can arrest and do all these things to if it was there. What I'm doing is breaking through their
(1:26:31) veil. They're not allowed to even talk to me as a man. They're not even allowed to
(1:26:38) talk to me. I'm going to break through their veil and educate them. Create that barrier that because if if you did
(1:26:44) something as the vessel, now you are that ward of the court. You now the sheriff takes you away. You're in that
(1:26:50) system. Ah, what did I say? Genesis 1:26-28. God gave me man, dominion over
(1:26:56) the land, the air, and the water. And this is law. I'm going to show you how to take dominion this weekend. And when
(1:27:03) you take dominion over all three jurisdictions, you are free. If you jump
(1:27:08) out of one into another with both feet, they'll destroy you in the other two.
(1:27:15) All these wonderful patriot groups out there, I love them.
(1:27:20) But they're trying to jump out of two jurisdictions into one. And they go to
(1:27:27) jail over and over over again. I've watched them do it for 35 years. And then I watch the people behind them not
(1:27:33) stand up for him when they get there. And I'll I can show you how to be
(1:27:39) free. So you never never get into that position. Okay.
(1:27:51) That's probably a good time. So, I form three questions out of this to the judge in my notice of a
(1:27:58) special appearance. I say, "Judge or your
(1:28:04) honor, do you claim to derive your authority over me based upon your oath
(1:28:09) of office and any other requirement of the state? Yes or no?
(1:28:19) May I have a copy of those to make sure that they're up to date and current before I arrive into
(1:28:26) court? Because if he doesn't have his current oath on file the way he's supposed to, and they seldom do,
(1:28:33) case dismissed. Judge, do you claim to derive
(1:28:39) your authority over me based upon statute? Yes or no?
(1:28:45) I'm setting him up. I'm pinning him in a
(1:28:50) corner because he's going to answer yes. Of course I do. Great. Then where's my
(1:28:56) paycheck stubs? Where's my company car? Where's my 401k? You're claiming I'm a
(1:29:01) I'm an employee of the state, of the county, of the city. Where's my paycheck stubs? I think
(1:29:08) you owe me a bunch. How much do you make? How much these state employees get paid for driving a car around? Paid for
(1:29:16) by the state. Can they get you on contempt for that? I'm not at war. See, that's another
(1:29:24) thing. What is a war rant? It's a a warrant. What is a warrant?
(1:29:30) It's a war rant. It's a declaration of war. They're declaring war upon you. I'm
(1:29:35) at peace. On my house, I fly the civil flag of peace. I walk into the courtroom
(1:29:40) with the flag of peace on my document. What's the flag of peace? They can't
(1:29:46) declare war on me when I'm at peace. They can't hold me for contempt when I'm at peace. This is just a
(1:29:52) discussion and they can't out debate me. Is it a physical flag that you have?
(1:29:58) Yeah. What does it look like? Yeah. Gosh, you all think we have one flag in this country?
(1:30:04) We have lots of flags. The red, white, and blue that you all see is our war flag.
(1:30:12) We have a peace flag, too. And it's red and white vertical stripes
(1:30:17) with a white background with blue stars. Look at the Look at the United States
(1:30:23) Coast Guard's flag. It's a civil flag of peace because they were developed as a civil organization and then they put
(1:30:29) their logo in the middle of it and they called it the Coast Guard flag, but it's on a civil flag of peace.
(1:30:37) For three years in this country, this country was at peace and we flew the civil flag over all of our commerce
(1:30:43) buildings and our capitals. Really? Three years.
(1:30:49) A long time ago, brother. We have been at war ever since especially since
(1:30:55) rotten Lincoln
(1:31:00) stinking Lincoln communist follower of Carl Marx failed five times to run for
(1:31:07) as president because nobody wanted him. Wasn't until the big bankers of Boston, New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia got
(1:31:13) behind and put seven million in his campaign that he finally won. And then he couldn't be president of the desure
(1:31:19) United States of America. So he bankrupted and formed a Delaware Corporation and he made him put the
(1:31:24) Grand Army of the Republic in charge of the United States and then he made himself commander-in-chief and that's why every president since has been sworn
(1:31:31) in as commander-in-chief as well as the president of the corporation.
(1:31:37) President Trump is the first man that restored the republic by executive order. In fact,
(1:31:44) June 22nd of 2019 in the Rose Garden, he gave me that
(1:31:49) hat. One more reason why they're against me. Explain that again.
(1:31:54) And he told me, "I restored the Republic and now it's up to you."
(1:32:00) And if you look at all his executive orders, I don't care whether you're a Trump fan or not, but if you're not, you
(1:32:06) will be by the end of this [Laughter]
(1:32:12) weekend. Because every executive order he has written goes something like this.
(1:32:19) I, Donald J. Trump is president of the United States of America. That's our
(1:32:24) desure government. Take back our utilities from the United States,
(1:32:31) which is the corporation. Do you know what he just did? And people read that
(1:32:36) and they don't even know jurisdiction. See, they don't even know what he did. And he's done that over and
(1:32:43) over and over again on behalf of the people. He just keeps restoring the republic over and over and over again.
(1:32:48) right now he's destroying the WHO and Fouchy and the CDC and the and the
(1:32:54) pharmaceutical companies. He's destroying Western medicine.
(1:32:59) He's destroying it all on behalf of you. Yes. He signed four executive orders and
(1:33:05) then he had to hop on an airplane for fear he'd be shot. They always try to kill him. Five times
(1:33:11) in the last week. Five attempts. Five in the last week. Yep. just in the
(1:33:17) last week. Yeah, they're not grasping for straw.
(1:33:24) They got to shut him down. That's right. He knows it. And he's got
(1:33:31) the best Secret Service agents this history has ever seen. Those boys are
(1:33:37) tough. If not, he'd be dead. I've heard rumors
(1:33:44) take the go to your bank and see how much coins they have. See our coinage.
(1:33:51) He took back for the United States of America. The Fed doesn't have access to
(1:33:56) it. There's a ton going on. I I know IRS agents that have already received their pink slip and been told to look for
(1:34:03) another job. Okay. Federal Reserve got into the wage and income tax has never
(1:34:09) been legal. It's always been a gift. Abe Lincoln did the 1040 bonds. The 1040 is
(1:34:16) still here. You consent to it by filling it out and signing it and sending it in. By your own consent, admission, you pay
(1:34:23) taxes. Nobody at the IRS can figure out why you keep sending
(1:34:28) them in. They just can't figure that out. But you just keep doing it and they keep getting that gift and they love
(1:34:34) every minute of it. Okay. Judge, do you claim to derive your authority over me based upon the
(1:34:40) doctrine of parents patry? Yes or no? They don't want to answer that question.
(1:34:46) So I said, "Judge, yes or
(1:34:54) no? Judge, I need an answer to that question. Yes or no? You don't want them
(1:35:01) to get away with okay? They're your public servants. Take control of the courtroom
(1:35:07) because he's going to assert that he doesn't have to answer to you. Yeah, he absolutely does. He absolutely does. He
(1:35:14) lost all immunity. He tries to take back command of that court. Look, you know, I'm the only state in the United States
(1:35:20) I've never been in is West Virginia. Do you know I helped remove the entire Supreme Court of West
(1:35:27) Virginia off the bench a couple years ago was in all the papers. I've never even been in that
(1:35:32) state. But they were doing a lot of people harm. So we got them off the bench. They
(1:35:39) lose their immunity when they step outside of the scope and authority of the law in which
(1:35:45) we the people lay down. The minute they step outside of
(1:35:51) that scope and authority, they lost their immunity. As long as they're operating inside that, they're immune.
(1:35:56) We can't touch them. We can't sue them. But if we can prove all the laws they create,
(1:36:04) Okay, this is the most important question. You got to get them to answer these three questions. You get them to answer. Judge, do you claim to derive
(1:36:11) your authority over me based upon your oath of office, statute, parents,
(1:36:17) Patrick? You got to get them to answer it. Once you do, you can destroy the
(1:36:22) case with those three questions. Because if I'm not a citizen,
(1:36:28) person, or resident, they have no authority over me. the statute I have limited
(1:36:33) diplomatic immunity. Do you need to ask each of those limited
(1:36:38) diplomatic immunity? That means if I don't kill someone or rape someone or injure another human being, I am immune
(1:36:45) from any statute. The only thing I can be held accountable of is harming
(1:36:51) someone else. Love thy neighbor, do no harm. That's that's our motto. Okay, we're at peace. We love thy neighbor and
(1:36:58) do no harm. Does being at peace mean we can't shoot them in the head when they try and steal our kids? No, it does not.
(1:37:05) You are protecting your That's right. In fact, most states have the imminent
(1:37:11) domain or castle laws. Our home is our castle. Okay. Now, should we give them
(1:37:18) fair warning? Yes, we should. It's what no trespassing signs are for. That's why
(1:37:24) you don't open your door. You don't step out on the threshold to talk to them.
(1:37:31) You hand them a little warning notice through the door while it's still chained and you close the door and you
(1:37:38) lock it behind you and then they get to read. And if you wrote that notice
(1:37:44) properly, they'll get in their car and they'll drive off and they won't come see you again. Three very, very
(1:37:51) important questions and sometimes you must ask it three times. So, so if they
(1:37:58) refuse, you say, "All right, your honor, I've asked you three times. You've refused to answer. This case is now
(1:38:05) dismissed without prejudice." And you walk out the door and don't look back. Will you do
(1:38:12) all this as you start walking up? As you're walking up, if you're sitting
(1:38:18) in the back row and they call your name, the minute you take your first step,
(1:38:25) I'm here by special divine appearance, your honor, to call for a constitutional court of record before you even get
(1:38:32) through that bar. Okay. Okay. Otherwise, you probably got chance,
(1:38:38) right? Right. Well, you got to Well, you have to establish your status,
(1:38:45) standing and jurisdiction. So, let's talk about that status. We already did a little bit
(1:38:55) standing, jurisdiction. I'm going to write it way
(1:39:00) over here. Why do I do that?
(1:39:05) First of all, the bar association misuses the word jurisdiction on purpose to confuse the
(1:39:11) public. It's probably the most misused word in the legal
(1:39:18) arena. Okay, the legal stage. Why do I say that? Because I've
(1:39:27) already told you what the three jurisdictions are. Land, air, and water.
(1:39:33) It's trust law, equity law, contract
(1:39:40) law. That's our three jurisdictions. What does the word jurist mean? It means
(1:39:48) right law. What does the word diction mean?
(1:39:55) You look words up in a dictionary, don't you? The words you use determines the right
(1:40:02) law under which you stand. So if I say I'm a
(1:40:08) party, what law am I under? The jurisdiction of the water.
(1:40:13) I'm a party to a contract. If I say I'm a trustee, what jurisdiction am I under?
(1:40:19) The air. If I say I'm a owner who holds superior
(1:40:26) title, I'm in the jurisdiction of land. April the 22nd, I put on a class
(1:40:34) at the Department of Justice in Washington DC in front of a whole group of young
(1:40:41) lawyers. William Barer actually set that up for me.
(1:40:46) Okay. And I put on a class similar to what I'm putting on now.
(1:40:51) But I didn't have as much time. So I had to cram it in really fast and in a very
(1:40:57) specific order. But I taught them 1 plus 1 is two. They didn't know that. They
(1:41:03) didn't know the basics of law. They're out there trying to do
(1:41:10) algebra and they don't even know 1 plus 1 is two. So I asked him, where what is the
(1:41:17) law? Where did it come from? Where's its origins? How did we arrive at this thing called law where a small group of men
(1:41:24) could put something down on paper and hold me a man accountable? And I stood there like
(1:41:32) this. You could have heard a pin drop. They couldn't come up with an
(1:41:39) answer. They said, "Oh, one one kid piped up and says, "Oh, it's Bill on
(1:41:46) Capitol Hill." And you know that little cartoon thing, he was repeating that I just
(1:41:55) went and then I told him about Genesis 1:26-28 and I told them the basics of
(1:42:01) law and I taught them about jurisdiction. See, they thought it was in the city's jurisdiction or the county's jurisdiction or the state's
(1:42:08) jurisdiction or the federal governments or this agency or that agency. They thought that was what jurisdiction
(1:42:14) means. No, that's venue. Who has the authority over in
(1:42:20) that location is venue? Jurisdiction is do they have
(1:42:27) authority in and in which law? Do do they have
(1:42:33) authority? So after I got done, this young attorney came up, 29 years old. He
(1:42:38) looked like he was 12. He was a grandson of a judge and the son of a judge. long line of judges,
(1:42:45) very smart man. He could rattle things off like you wouldn't believe it. But he thanked me for what I had
(1:42:53) taught. And he said, "Can I tell you a story?" And I said, "Sure." He says, "When he was 16 years
(1:43:00) old and his dad was teaching at Georgetown Law, he got to go and sit in
(1:43:06) one of his dad's classes. and his dad taught law just like I
(1:43:11) did. Land, air, and water.
(1:43:18) And he says, "But he said it a little bit differently than you did." And I said, "Well, how did he say it?" Because
(1:43:24) I took several hours to talk about it. He says, "He he he said it in a few minutes." And I said, "Well, then I want
(1:43:31) to know because I've been doing this like 35 years, right? And the first 20 years, I made it really complicated and
(1:43:38) I could talk really fast and I would just blow people's minds and none of them would listen and I'd have a group
(1:43:43) of 20 people and then a year later I'd go back and I'd still have the same group of 20 people. I go, "This isn't
(1:43:51) working." About the noisiest little go-kart I've ever heard. Anyway, I said, "This isn't
(1:43:57) working. If I'm going to get the same people year after year, the same 20, this isn't going to work. How can I wake
(1:44:03) up America?" Right. And he said this. He says, "When
(1:44:08) a man walks into a courtroom, the very first thing he sees when he walks in is
(1:44:16) a little sign up on the judge's desk that says, "Your honorable Bob Smith," or whatever the judge's name happens to
(1:44:22) be. The reason it says honor is because you can't have honor
(1:44:27) without trust. You can't have trust without honor. Which form of law is trust law? the jurisdiction, the highest
(1:44:34) form of law. It is superior law. There is nothing more important in the law
(1:44:40) than having a fidiciary responsibility for the benefit of
(1:44:45) another. Okay? So, he said this, the very first job title hat the judge puts
(1:44:51) on when he walks in the room is your honor hat. The very first thing he's going to
(1:44:58) administer, the first jurists he's going to administer is the jurisdiction of the
(1:45:03) heir. He wants to see if the man walked in with his express trust in
(1:45:09) hand. There's two types of trusts.
(1:45:16) Express and implied. This is written and this is
(1:45:23) unwritten. And if the man doesn't walk in with his express trust in hand, then the judge is
(1:45:30) going to imply a trust where he's the executive and you're the trustee who
(1:45:36) somehow mismanaged the trust on behalf of the beneficiary who's the prosecution or whoever is bringing the
(1:45:43) case. And therefore, you owe the prosecution something for your
(1:45:49) mismanagement. What is a misdemeanor, by the way? What
(1:45:55) is demeanor? It's your attitude. It's a miss. You got a bad attitude, go sit in
(1:46:01) the corner. You got a misdemeanor. You got the wrong attitude. That's what a contempt charge is. It's a
(1:46:09) misdemeanor. Right. All right. Words are important and we just don't understand
(1:46:15) them. Never taught English at school. It's why it's why attorneys have a whole
(1:46:21) separate word for it. They call it legal ease. Legal ease is a separation of words in the English language into one
(1:46:29) of three juris. So if I'm a driver or an operator
(1:46:36) of a motor vehicle upon the highways, I have to have a driver's
(1:46:41) license. But if I'm traveling in private upon the high on the roadways in my
(1:46:46) private automobile, all I need is my
(1:46:53) passport. See the difference in the words? They both mean going down the street in a car. Both those
(1:47:01) sentences say, but the word you use determines the jury you're under. And
(1:47:07) it's up to you to determine your own words. Most people get their That's
(1:47:12) right. They open their mouth. Yeah. You have the right to remain silent. Everything you say can
(1:47:18) and absolutely will be used against you.
(1:47:23) Okay. And they'll bait you. Those cops will go, "Now, are you driving that
(1:47:29) automobile?" No, they won't say that. They'll ask you if you're operating that
(1:47:34) motor vehicle. Right? So if the man walks in with his
(1:47:41) express trust in hand that clearly states who the executive is, who the
(1:47:46) trustee is, has an acceptance of the trustee to be the trustee, that's so they can't break the
(1:47:52) trust veil. It's important tells who the beneficiary is, what property the trust
(1:47:59) is managing, and how it's supposed to be managed for who the heirs.
(1:48:06) then there's nothing for him to adjudicate. He can't imply a trust if
(1:48:11) there's an express trust in hand. He has to go by the express trust.
(1:48:16) And you know what? Trusts are private. You don't have to show the judge a trust. He he does not need to read it.
(1:48:23) All you have to do is walk in and you say, "Judge, you can't imply a trust when I
(1:48:31) have an express trust that clearly states who the executive is, who the trustee is, has an acceptance of the
(1:48:38) trustee to be the trustee. It tells who the heirs are and the beneficiaries, what property is supposed to be managed
(1:48:44) by the trust, and how the trust is supposed to be managed. And then you just set it back
(1:48:49) down on your table." He can't adjudicate it. So, he has to take that hat
(1:48:58) off. And he puts on his judge
(1:49:05) hat. Now, he's looking to see if there's a victim. If there's a victim, there's a crime. It's going to trial. Physical
(1:49:12) injury to another. If there's not, it's civil.
(1:49:17) turns his head around and he's looking to see if the
(1:49:23) man walked in with his superior titles in hand. Wait a minute. If it's a
(1:49:30) automobile case, do you have your MSO or MCO and you walk in with it? If you don't, he's going to imply
(1:49:37) the state has a certificate of title. The state owns it, and he's going to
(1:49:42) regulate you, and you're guilty.
(1:49:48) Ah, you see now, let's say it's a foreclosure. If you walk in like Ken
(1:49:54) Cromer did with his land patent after I taught him how to do it and his grant
(1:49:59) deeds and his superior titles in hand, they can't imply an abstracted
(1:50:07) title. So Ken gets to move back in his house. Okay.
(1:50:14) What about your life? If you walk in having claimed your minor estate and
(1:50:21) taken ownership of your birth certificate in hand and you now own the vessel, you're
(1:50:26) not just a signatory officer. See, what is a person? A person
(1:50:33) is an office of the vessel. That's your job title. You're an employee as a
(1:50:40) person. That's why every state statute starts off by saying all persons must do this and all
(1:50:47) persons must do that and all persons must do this. They don't say all men and women must do this. They can't regulate
(1:50:54) a man or a woman. They can't regulate somebody alive. You can only regulate a dead
(1:51:00) entity, a vessel, a person, a signatory officer. If I'm a man and I write my
(1:51:06) autobiography, which is the story of my life, and I go to the bookstore and sell it, and people line up to buy my
(1:51:14) book, do I put my signature on it or I sign my autograph? A man signs his
(1:51:21) autograph and he does it on this side of the paper. A signator goes on this side of
(1:51:27) the paper. A trustee signs in the
(1:51:33) middle. A signatory signs in blue with black
(1:51:39) ink. A man signs in red. A trustee having fidiciary responsibility signs in
(1:51:50) purple. Guys don't know the law. There's three jurisdictions. There's three places for a signature. There should be
(1:51:57) three seals. Do you have your own seal for each of your
(1:52:02) jurisdictions? Guess you're not free.
(1:52:09) Okay. So, if you have all your superior titles
(1:52:14) in hand and you stand firmly upon your rights, there's nothing for him to adjudicate. So, he takes his judge hat
(1:52:20) off and he puts on his Mr. Administrator hat. Okay. Now, he wants to see if you
(1:52:26) have your business affairs in order. He's looking at the jurisdiction of the water. He wants to see
(1:52:31) contracts. He wants to see your business affairs. Think Michael Jordan and Nike
(1:52:38) for just a minute. Michael Jordan signed a five-year contract with Nike for a
(1:52:43) billion dollars, $200 million a year, just so they could use his name.
(1:52:51) It's a good gig if you can get it, right?
(1:52:57) During that time, a police officer couldn't even write Michael Jordan's name on a ticket without the prior express written permission of Nike or
(1:53:04) Michael Jordan. See, they can regulate commerce,
(1:53:09) but they can't interfere in it. Title 15 of the United States Code becomes your
(1:53:15) savior because it says any documents that they used your trademark name on
(1:53:20) must be destroyed. So that ticket goes through a paper
(1:53:26) shredder. You want to trademark your name.
(1:53:31) Absolutely. You want to trademark your name. So how do you take dominion over your three jurises is first you do a
(1:53:39) trust and and now I'm going to back up. You have to take status first. You got
(1:53:45) to claim who you are. Claim your status.
(1:53:52) Did we make enough copies of those? Pass one of those out to everybody. You have to claim your
(1:53:59) status. Status, standing, and jurisdiction is everything in the law.
(1:54:06) Everything. You have to know who you are and what's status. Maximal law again is that in
(1:54:12) which one creates, one controls. As a state national, I'm one
(1:54:19) of we the people who created government. Guess what? I control
(1:54:25) government. Government created the US citizen. Guess who they control? You,
(1:54:32) the US citizen. Say, we're not free in this
(1:54:38) country. As long as you self-determine that you're a US citizen, you are not
(1:54:44) free. Now, is there anything wrong with being a US citizen?
(1:54:49) Yeah, there is. That was a trick question I was throwing out there.
(1:54:56) Yeah. So, you need to do your trust to take dominion over the
(1:55:01) air. You need to have your superior
(1:55:09) titles and know your rights.
(1:55:15) to take dominion over the
(1:55:24) land. Now, Michael Jordan and Nike, that's what I was on that story. Let me ask you a question. CPS
(1:55:32) comes in people's houses every day and they steal kids. They kidnap kids as a
(1:55:37) private for-profit entity, not government.
(1:55:44) Half the people I talk to are not bad parents. Now, every once in a while,
(1:55:49) there's a drug dealer or somebody like that that needs their kids taken from them. Who should take them? A church or
(1:55:59) a family member. It's not up to government. Government shouldn't even be
(1:56:05) involved in the family unit at all. Zero. None. They have
(1:56:11) no business being in your family. Okay?
(1:56:20) None. I get sometimes 70 to 100 phone calls a day from parents all over this
(1:56:28) country whose children have been taken every day, day in day out.
(1:56:34) I was with her yesterday and I got a phone call to
(1:56:40) listen their story. Brought me to tears, didn't it? Not many people can handle those
(1:56:48) kind of
(1:56:55) stories. What if I had a business ABC Inc.
(1:57:03) licensed by the Secretary of State's office, bonded with a gold and silver,
(1:57:10) which I like to
(1:57:17) use. One of the number one ways the government gets you is by being a popper. I don't care how big a stack of
(1:57:24) this crap you have in your pocket. That's legal tender.
(1:57:30) It does not discharge a debt. It tenders it to a later
(1:57:36) date. When the probate of the balance sheet of the CES QB trust gets probated,
(1:57:43) the debts get paid. This never pays off a debt. It
(1:57:49) tenders it to a later
(1:57:57) date. But that does
(1:58:02) And if you've got a silver or a gold coin on you, they can never deem you a
(1:58:10) popper. And if you look in the law what a popper means, every US citizen is
(1:58:15) deemed a popper, therefore a debtor. And they can never deem you a popper if you've got a little gold and a
(1:58:23) little silver on you. In my pickup truck, I carry a little
(1:58:28) jeweler's sack with 40 pieces of silver on the
(1:58:35) door. They can never deem me a popper. But it doesn't Good man.
(1:58:46) But it gives them control. You're unable to handle your own affairs.
(1:58:52) See who, if you look up in the law, who can an attorney represent? They can represent an entity,
(1:58:59) a corporation, or a vessel. They can represent a minor. They can represent
(1:59:04) someone incompetent or somebody infirmed. They can represent a ward of the court
(1:59:11) and a ward of the state or a popper.
(1:59:20) Did I leave some words out? See, they can't represent a man or a woman.
(1:59:30) Yeah, they can't represent a man or a woman. It takes three signatures to put
(1:59:35) you in jail. Did you know that? And if they don't have those three, you can't
(1:59:40) go to jail. Anybody know Gina Nielson over in uh Cash County, Utah?
(1:59:51) I met Gina after her trial. She was found guilty by a jury and she was going to be sentenced
(1:59:59) to 15 years in the state prison. By the way, Gina got held in
(2:00:06) contempt and thrown in jail for a little bit, but that's not a prison sentence.
(2:00:12) That's a misdemeanor and it's go sit in the corner. You've been naughty.
(2:00:21) But she never spent one day in jail and she never will. Her case has been
(2:00:28) dismissed. Why? Because I told her they require three signatures to put you in jail,
(2:00:35) Gina. They require yours by taking a plea. the prosecutors and the judges or
(2:00:44) your attorney who will sign as your power of attorney on your behalf and throw you in
(2:00:51) jail. So, it takes one of three signatures, the judges, the prosecutors,
(2:00:58) and either yours or your attorney. It's why they try and force you to have an
(2:01:03) attorney because you're incompetent. You're infirmed. You're unable to speak for yourself. You're a citizen, a
(2:01:08) person, a resident. You're not suejurous. What does suejurus mean of
(2:01:15) one's own right? I walk in the courtroom sue
(2:01:21) jurist and they can't even speak to me. I have to tell them what to do.
(2:01:27) say they might argue with me a little bit but they never win. They can't win.
(2:01:33) It's impossible for them to win when you're
(2:01:38) serious. When you've taken dominion over your three jurisdictions, they can't win. So let's get back to Michael Jordan
(2:01:45) and Nike. What if you ha owned your children? You took
(2:01:52) ownership of their vessels as your biner children and you held them in trust and you trademarked or
(2:01:59) patented or did both your children. See what is the jurisdiction
(2:02:07) of the water? It's commerce, right? It's contracts and
(2:02:14) commerce. It's corporate bylaws. It's
(2:02:25) banking, but most important, it's contract law.
(2:02:30) So, if I had a business, ABC, Inc., licensed with the state bonded with gold
(2:02:36) and silver and I went to the United States Patent and Trademark Office website and
(2:02:42) on their TE's plus form I trademarked my vessels mine my kids my
(2:02:50) families doing under a bulk trademark under that business name and I took
(2:02:56) ownership of that meaning their names business name all cap's name their
(2:03:01) vessel name the one that's on their birth certificate get. Okay, we're talking about taking
(2:03:06) control of their vessel because that's what the courts care about. That's what they have parents patri over,
(2:03:14) right? You have parental rights over your living children. The problem is you don't have any living children. They're
(2:03:20) all dead entities to the state. See, so they take control over the vessel
(2:03:26) through parents patray. But if I take control over the vessel and I own my
(2:03:31) property, which is my children, they're a gift from God to me, okay, and I patent them and I on the
(2:03:40) land, I put them in trust as a fidiciary and I trademark them in with my
(2:03:46) business. And my business has a EIN number and a bank account and a product
(2:03:52) offered for sale in international commerce. And my business
(2:03:58) has the intent to make a profit. And I go out and I put my
(2:04:04) children's names on t-shirts, my name on a t-shirt, and their names on a t-shirt,
(2:04:09) just like Michael Jordan's name on a Nike t-shirt, and I offer them for sale on a website for
(2:04:16) $19.95. I'd make it 21.95. There's a little key about getting over 20 bucks.
(2:04:23) Okay. So, I offer for sale for over 20 bucks on the internet and I walk into court wearing
(2:04:31) one of those t-shirts and this is a child protection services case.
(2:04:39) And I say I don't talk about the facts of the case because in reality in their courts no truth or fact shall be tried
(2:04:45) in court. It's all based upon presumption, assumption, task, agreement, and hearsay. That's their motto. No truth or
(2:04:52) fact shall be tried in court. Okay. And I walk in there and I say, "Uh, you can't interfere in
(2:04:59) commerce, your honor. You can only regulate it. You're interfering in a
(2:05:07) trademark. I demand the return of my property, my trademarked property, and
(2:05:14) any document that idiot prosecutor put that name on without my express written prior permission. I demand for it to be
(2:05:22) destroyed under USC title
(2:05:27) 15. Case dismissed. So you walk in with your
(2:05:32) superior titles. You walk in with your express trust. You walk in with your business affairs in order. And there's
(2:05:38) nothing left for them to adjudicate. Case dismissed.
(2:05:44) I just told you how to win every lawsuit every time they come against you. But
(2:05:51) you have to get your affairs in order. You have to claim your status. You have
(2:05:56) to set up your trust. You have to record your superior titles and get hold of them and record them. Anyway, just
(2:06:04) curious.
(2:06:11) Your offer to contract is not accepted. So, would you ignore it, not pay it? You
(2:06:16) have a 72-hour right of recision. You ignore anything, you're in trouble. Never ignore anything. Okay, that's what
(2:06:22) I thought. Everything is banking laws. If your credit card company sends
(2:06:27) you out a bill, an invoice, you take it and you say, "All right, I'll get to that and I'll pin it up on my fridge."
(2:06:33) And I forget about it. Right? Then what do they do? They send you a pass due notice because you had 30 days to pay
(2:06:40) that bill. You had 72 hours first to resend the contract once you filled out the credit card application. You had 72
(2:06:47) hours to stop it. You didn't. You got the card in the mail. You went out and spent some money. Then they sent you a
(2:06:53) bill. You got 30 days to pay it. If you don't pay it, they give you a 15-day
(2:06:59) past due notice. You got 15 days to pay it. At the 16th day, they cancel your
(2:07:05) credit card and they send you to collections.
(2:07:12) If you know anything about contracts, there's no privity of contract with a collection agent. Okay? So, let's say
(2:07:19) you owe a medical bill at the hospital and you can't pay
(2:07:24) it. So, they send it for collections. They do this every day of the week, right? To just about everybody. And you can't pay it. And a
(2:07:32) collection agency goes to the hospital and buys that debt for 50 cents on the dollar. And then they try and collect
(2:07:38) from you. man, they call you up on the phone. You know what I say? I have a totally different conversation with them than
(2:07:44) you do. You run over the top of me. I say,
(2:07:51) "Oh my gosh, did you purchase that debt from the hospital?" And they say, "Well, yes, we
(2:07:58) did." I say, "Thank you very much. I really needed that help in my life at this time. Thank you for doing that."
(2:08:06) But you and I, there's no privity of contract.
(2:08:12) But I appreciate it. And I'm done. Does that So does it work
(2:08:17) different if it's like those are governmentbacked?
(2:08:24) Pay for them with your sust.
(2:08:29) He He just shakes his head and puts his head down. Did you see that? No. Wait a minute. Don't Don't go any further yet.
(2:08:35) Wait a minute. I said, "Pay for him with your CESTV
(2:08:41) trust." And what was your thought when you when I said that? And you just kind of closed up and put your head down.
(2:08:49) See, we the people need to make friends with the
(2:08:56) United States Code. The United States Code was put into place for one reason, one reason only,
(2:09:03) and that's for us to hold our public servants accountable. In USC
(2:09:09) 50 there, Title 50, there is a way to pay your debts with your Sustic UV
(2:09:17) trust. You're the creditor, but you can't do it if you're
(2:09:22) a citizen. caveat. You have to become a state
(2:09:27) national. You have to become one of we the people. There's not many of us left. I think we've created about 40,000 we
(2:09:35) the peoples in this country. Maybe a little more than that. That was probably a year ago's
(2:09:40) figure. And that's it out of 337 million. Because every contract
(2:09:47) written is written by an attorney. And do you ever look at a document that's written by an attorney? And it's got
(2:09:53) lines on it and it's got little boxes on it and things are boxed out. See, they
(2:09:59) know English language. They know legal ease. They know
(2:10:04) styles and they write contracts to eliminate the liability from the person
(2:10:12) paying them to write the contract and place that liability upon you.
(2:10:18) So, they wrote you an unfair contract and what you didn't do is walk in, sit
(2:10:24) down with them, get an agreement on how much to pay and how much to pay you were
(2:10:29) going to pay and how much your down was, and then go home and write the contract, bring it back and say, "Here, here's my
(2:10:35) contract. Sign this [Music]
(2:10:42) and you didn't do it." See, you could have wrote a fair and honest contract,
(2:10:48) but you didn't. And so, they took advantage of you because you didn't know
(2:10:54) any better. How many law classes did you have kindergarten through 12th grade? See, I say that over and over again
(2:11:01) because nobody does. And that's why when I was telling you the story about Justin in the Space
(2:11:06) Needle in Seattle and his his buddy that came over that
(2:11:12) hired him says, "Who do you think controls it all? We write all the contracts. We write all the sales
(2:11:18) literature. We write all the invoices. We write we do this. We do that. We do it all. The bar
(2:11:25) association runs the world." And who are they?
(2:11:32) Do you know who they are? British. The British Accreditation Registry. The
(2:11:38) United States of America has a treaty 1947 with the bar to operate upon these
(2:11:44) shores. Wasn't the first one. That's the newest one. Our country back way back then. Okay. If if you if you go to the
(2:11:51) communist country of Illinois that Abraham Lincoln used to run, if you go to their website, you
(2:11:58) look under the office of the attorney general of the state of Illinois and you click on the history tab, it says the
(2:12:05) attorney general's office of the state of Illinois was put into place to protect and uphold the interests of the
(2:12:10) crown. Isn't the attorney general the highest
(2:12:17) lawyer in the land of Illinois? And it was put into place to protect and uphold the interest of the
(2:12:24) crown. The British accreditation registry is under the crown under the US.
(2:12:32) Wouldn't that be treason? Hold on a minute. No, we adopted it. You
(2:12:40) acquanced. You haven't fought to change it. No, I'm just saying. Okay. When I
(2:12:46) say you, I I'm not pointing directly at you. Okay. No, here here's the issue.
(2:12:52) The issue is they're supposed to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act under
(2:12:59) FAR. They don't. The British Accreditation
(2:13:04) Registry. You walk into a courtroom right here in Utah and if you're not a member of the
(2:13:12) bar, they're not going to let you talk for somebody else, right? I can't go in and represent her unless I'm a member of
(2:13:18) the bar in Utah. They'll say, "No." Great. Show me
(2:13:24) where a bar licensed attorney is licensed by the state of
(2:13:29) Utah. They aren't. They're licensed by the bar. It's a labor union. It's no
(2:13:35) different than IBW Electrical Workers Credit Union.
(2:13:42) So they don't have any more jurisdiction than you? No, none whatsoever. Except that's what that satanic cult called a
(2:13:50) court operates. The bar is Satan,
(2:13:57) guys. And five or six of those members are the head of the church.
(2:14:04) Yeah. You wonder why Utah's all screwed up, church, huh?
(2:14:14) Yeah. What I'm What I'm trying to trying to say here is we need to take
(2:14:19) our country back as we the people. And we're at war with the bar
(2:14:25) association. And people don't even realize that. And some of our friends and our family and our next door
(2:14:30) neighbors are attorneys. And you know what the sad thing is? They don't
(2:14:37) know. Everybody is a compartmentalized legal
(2:14:42) idiot. Everybody. I don't care what job you have. You go to work every day and you
(2:14:49) just do your job and you have no idea what's going on over here or what's
(2:14:54) going on over here. See, if I laid the map of Utah out here,
(2:15:01) and this is Utah, the land, the geographical area map, and I drew a land patent on that
(2:15:08) map, and I put your home in that land patent where you got it through a grant
(2:15:14) deed, then you actually have a superior title and you own that land, that home.
(2:15:21) But if I come in and I put a clear piece of plastic over the top and I do things like change your
(2:15:29) name to all caps and I change your address and
(2:15:34) instead of land patent number 4361, I put lot three of block 27 of Spring Hill
(2:15:42) subdivision and I redescribe your property and I take it out of meets and bounds and I make all kinds of clerical
(2:15:50) errors. ers and you come in and I send you those clerical errors on your tax invoice and
(2:15:57) you just write a check and send it back. Guess what? I just stole your property on
(2:16:03) behalf of the state and you accept it. And until you come back and call
(2:16:10) fraud and correct the errors and educate me so I never do it again because see it
(2:16:15) took a lot of people. It took a cgrapher. It took a appraiser. It took a tax
(2:16:23) assessor. It took a county recorder. It took a real estate agent, a title company, an attorney. Blah blah blah. It
(2:16:30) took all these compartmentalized legal idiots to create a conspiracy to deprive
(2:16:36) me of my land. And every one of them was just
(2:16:42) doing their job. But when you add them all up and put the results together, that's exactly what
(2:16:49) they did is they stole my home on behalf of the state and they didn't even know
(2:16:57) it. So I'm not saying rush in and declare war on them and start yelling at
(2:17:02) them and tell them everything they did wrong. You got to correct all the errors
(2:17:09) and then educate them. We're seeing that now. Yeah.
(2:17:14) That's exactly what they're doing. These damn sheep around here that are wearing masks are killing this country.
(2:17:22) The recovery rate for CO. That's
(2:17:28) right. Less than the common cold, lessen the flu, lessen H1N1, lessen all the
(2:17:34) things we've had over the years. Why? We weren't in fear of it then. Why are we
(2:17:39) in fear of it now? How many people know somebody that died from it? I'm doing nine lawsuits right now. Nine lawsuits
(2:17:47) of family members that have died of COVID. One of them died in a motorcycle
(2:17:52) accident. One of them had stage four breast cancer, was with hospice for longer than
(2:17:58) she was supposed to live, but because they list COVID on her death certificate,
(2:18:05) she gets cremated. She had a plot already paid for next to
(2:18:10) her husband. and her family is pissed
(2:18:16) and they want to sue all nine of them. Their deaths were listed as CO and none of them died from
(2:18:23) CO. What is COVID 19?
(2:18:35) Okay, that's one term for it.
(2:18:40) It's C. The sheep surrender.
(2:18:48) 19 is the code word for surrender in the in the military. If I yell out an order, code 19. Code
(2:18:56) 19. That means my guys on the front line are supposed to wave a white flag.
(2:19:02) So, what's that mean? This is the ancient Greek word for sheep.
(2:19:12) This is a military code. The disease was called SARS Corona 2.
(2:19:19) Why did they change the name? In the 2019 perspectus of the WHO,
(2:19:28) which was written in 2018, it described everything that's going on right now to a tea. And this
(2:19:35) disease wasn't even here supposedly going clear back to 2003.
(2:19:44) So what did you say? This has been planned. Old old Greek or what? Sheep.
(2:19:56) Okay. It's all a barse. Is the d is the disease real? Yes, it is. Yes. Okay.
(2:20:03) What does corona mean? Corona. Corona is a crown. It's an energy
(2:20:08) crown. Okay. It is a
(2:20:14) bacteria. This whole germ theory thing has been debunked guys that you cannot
(2:20:21) pass COVID or corona whatever you want to name it. You can't pass it this way.
(2:20:30) you. The mask does nothing but harm you for wearing it. More people are now
(2:20:36) going to the hospital from the mask than were would have went for CO. Okay. Lot of staff infections, a lot of
(2:20:46) things. The N95 mask, OSHA will tell you that it would it's only good in a
(2:20:51) sterile environment. That means an operating room. Once out of the operating room, the
(2:20:57) doctors remove it, throw in the trash. It's only good in a sterile
(2:21:02) environment. This ain't a sterile environment. Okay? It's not meant to
(2:21:08) be. We have immune systems. The best way for us to be
(2:21:14) immune from disease is to touch things and get it on us. And then our
(2:21:22) body fights it off and it builds up an immunity. I haven't got sick in 40 years. I'm immune to everything. I live
(2:21:29) in horseshit. Okay. People are dying right now from hand sanitizer. They're getting
(2:21:37) the hand sanitizer that has methol in it, which almost all of them do, and they're getting them on their hands.
(2:21:43) They're absorbing it through their skin, and they're just dying from hand sanitizer. Bleaches and hand sanitizer
(2:21:50) are one of the largest destruction of mankind there is. I'm the youngest of eight kids. I got one sister who is a
(2:21:58) neat, clean freak. She's older than I am now. She spends all day in her
(2:22:04) retirement driving her kids and her grandkids to the doctors. She's got the sickest family
(2:22:10) I've ever seen. The rest of the seven kids, we all have farms. We all play in the
(2:22:17) We travel the world. We touch things. We seldom wash our hands. And we never get
(2:22:23) sick. You could eat underneath her sink off the floor. She bleaches everything.
(2:22:30) Everything is sanitized in her house. She's got the cleanest house in the face of this
(2:22:36) earth. And they're all sick all the time. We are creating a whole
(2:22:42) generation of weak people and that's what they want. Bill Gates would like to
(2:22:49) see a one-third to one half reduction in the number of people on this earth. You
(2:22:55) know he's committed genocide. Yes. Genocide. India. Well, in India, he
(2:23:00) didn't commit genocide, but he killed over 400,000 people. In Africa, he actually committed genocide. There's an
(2:23:07) entire race of Africa Africans who can never have children and once they die
(2:23:12) off they cease to exist. They're sterile because of his malaria
(2:23:19) drug had a sterilization component in it. Okay.
(2:23:27) the drug they're trying to produce right now for this that they're scaring
(2:23:32) everybody that they're getting children used to having a gun pointed at their head,
(2:23:38) pointing at their penal gland with these temperature things. That's right. They're they're getting you
(2:23:44) indoctrinated for destruction.
(2:23:50) Okay. The guy that made the chip, the way they keep the battery going on the
(2:23:56) chip is they have to put it in one of two places where the temperature changes the most. Right there in the hand or
(2:24:03) right there in the forehead. Can't put it in their forehead because everybody will see it and it'll look ugly. So,
(2:24:08) they're going to put it right here in your hand. And the natural temperature change of your this part of your hand
(2:24:14) keeps the battery going.
(2:24:20) You'll be able to walk up and pay for things with your hand. Gosh, you see the employees at that
(2:24:26) Wisconsin company lining up to get a jet. Take the mark of the beast in your
(2:24:32) hand. Read what it says about that in the Bible. And you go straight to
(2:24:40) hell. There ain't no forgiveness for that sin. Says it right in the Bible.
(2:24:48) Okay, don't do it. Defend your family, your family's
(2:24:56) life. It's their salvation. Eternal salvation is at stake. Okay. All right.
(2:25:04) I feel like a preacher. They don't mean to be a preacher, but that's what tends to happen with this
