This document consolidates the teachings and analyses of key individuals who influence the VeroBrix project.

## Anelia Sutton

### Core Concepts
- **Decoding Lawful Structures:** Sutton's primary focus is on "decoding" the legal system, which she views as intentionally complex. Her goal is to demystify legal language and procedures.
- **Challenging Presumptions:** A key tactic is to challenge the presumptions made by the court to disrupt the standard flow of legal proceedings.
- **Self-Empowerment:** Sutton encourages her followers to become "legal gladiators" and take control of their own legal battles.
- **Alignment with Sovereign Citizen Ideals:** Her teachings align with the movement's core tenets, including the rejection of governmental authority.

### Structured Legal Analysis
- **Access to Justice:** The complexity of the legal system ("legalese") is a significant barrier to justice. The plain language movement is a related, mainstream effort to simplify legal documents.
- **Challenging Presumptions:** This is a valid legal practice. *Rebuttable presumptions* can be challenged with contrary evidence. *Irrebuttable presumptions* are harder to challenge and often require a constitutional argument (e.g., violation of Due Process).
- **Rejecting Unlawful Authority:** While there is a basis for this (e.g., right to resist unlawful arrest in some jurisdictions, Nuremberg Principle), the recommended course of action is to challenge orders through legal channels rather than direct disobedience.
- **Pro Se Litigation (Self-Representation):** A fundamental right, but it is a challenging path that requires significant time, effort, and legal knowledge.

## David Straight

### Core Concepts
- **American State National Ideology:** Proposes that individuals can renounce U.S. citizenship to become "state nationals," shielding themselves from most federal and state laws.
- **The "Strawman" Theory:** Posits that the government creates a separate legal entity (the "strawman") for each individual, and one can separate from this entity to avoid legal obligations.
- **Misinterpretation of the "Right to Travel":** Argues that the constitutional "right to travel" means no driver's license or vehicle registration is needed.
- **Rejection of Government Authority:** The belief that the U.S. government is an illegitimate corporation.

### Structured Legal Analysis
- **"State National" Status:** This is not a legally recognized status. The 14th Amendment establishes that citizens of a state are also citizens of the U.S. The FBI considers the sovereign citizen movement a domestic extremist movement.
- **"Strawman" Theory:** This is a pseudolegal theory consistently rejected by courts. It has no basis in law, and individuals who use it have faced fines and imprisonment.
- **Right to Travel:** This right is not absolute. Courts have consistently held that driving is a privilege subject to reasonable regulation by the state to ensure public safety.

## Brandon Joe Williams

### Core Concepts
- **State National vs. U.S. Citizen:** Similar to David Straight, asserts that "U.S. citizen" is a corporate status and individuals can reclaim their "State National" status.
- **Legal Authorship & Precise Language:** Emphasizes the importance of drafting one's own legal documents with precise language, rather than using state-provided templates.
- **Contract Law as the Basis of a Just System:** The idea that all legal interactions are based on contracts that can be challenged.
- **Micronation and Diplomatic Immunity:** Has created a micronation to assert sovereignty and claim diplomatic immunity.

### Structured Legal Analysis
- **Legal Drafting:** The use of precise and unambiguous language is a critical skill in the legal profession to avoid disputes and ensure enforceability.
- **Contract Law:** This is a fundamental part of the legal system, providing a framework for creating and enforcing agreements.
- **Micronations:** These are not recognized as sovereign states under international law and cannot grant diplomatic immunity. This privilege is reserved for representatives of recognized states under the Vienna Convention.

## Carl Miller

### Core Concepts
- **The Death of the Gods & The New Global Power Grab:** Argues that traditional power structures (governments, corporations) are losing their monopoly on power to new digital actors (hackers, tech giants).
- **Information Warfare:** The internet is a new "theatre of war" where conflict occurs through the manipulation of information and control of online narratives.
- **Social Media Intelligence (SOCMINT):** Proponent of using data science to analyze online activity to understand and counter threats like disinformation and radicalization.

### Structured Legal Analysis
- **Information Warfare and International Law:** The legal framework is evolving. The "Tallinn Manual," an academic study, analyzes how existing international law (like the UN Charter) applies to cyber warfare. A key question is when a cyber operation constitutes a "use of force."
- **Domestic Law:** States are developing their own legal frameworks. In the U.S., the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the National Defense Authorization Act provide authority for conducting information operations.
