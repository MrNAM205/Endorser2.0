Transcript:
(00:03) good evening folks I want to thank you for inviting me into your home tonight to talk to you about an extremely
(00:09) important issue to you I I basically uh am here to talk about
(00:14) the United States Constitution and our government and some of the principles
(00:20) that uh you need to understand most thoroughly so that you can have an effective opportunity to exercise your
(00:27) constitutional rights the whole purpose of this is that you understand that these these rights come from God okay
(00:35) that they are God inspired God is the one who who endowed us with these rights and that this constitution merely
(00:41) offers a legitimate program to protect that all of us can have the rights equally and and as long as we respect
(00:49) our neighbor and allow them also to have the rights equally the the protections are going to last forever as and the
(00:56) reality is that we are going to get thoroughly into your Constitution we want you to find a
(01:02) constitution wherever you can and we are going to basically take you step by step through some of the most important parts
(01:08) of this constitution so that you can better exercise your rights in a timely fashion now the facts are simple if you
(01:14) don't know your rights you don't have any rights and that's just the way it is and if you certainly couldn't exercise
(01:20) those rights timely if you don't know what they are so what's going to happen is they're going to tell you what your rights are and do you think they're going to tell you in your favor
(01:26) certainly not now we've come a long way to put this program on to help you
(01:32) by the way my name is Carl Miller I want to thank you again for inviting me into your home we're going to proceed with
(01:38) Vigor I should tell you a few things about me that I'm a prior service Soldier I serve three combat tours
(01:44) Republic of Vietnam I should tell you that I was a participant in the top secret project called Blue Book where
(01:50) the officers in the jungle smelled a rat in a wood pile and they decided to pull their their top soldiers aside
(01:56) and they come on over here let's come on over here we want to talk to you and they took their top soldiers in the
(02:02) corner and they started teaching them things like duty honor country pride and the core they taught us history they
(02:08) taught us all kind of a programming as far as what's going on in our government they taught us the Constitution we had
(02:14) to be able to Rattle the Constitution off just like we would any Manual of arms and this all took place totally top
(02:20) secret so that we wouldn't offend any chains of command or any uh presidential problems similar to what uh
(02:27) happened between General McArthur the bottom line is uh this was taken totally
(02:33) upon their own shall we say careers to pull this thing off and they this
(02:38) happened all throughout a lot of the military services in Vietnam Marine Corps Air Force Army we all they all
(02:45) pulled aside their best people and they started putting everything on and teaching us our constitution so I'm
(02:50) going to try and instill in you that flame that was instilled in me over
(02:57) 25 years ago in which I have been I have been transferring ever since I have been fighting tooth and nail to defend the
(03:02) Constitution I have helped thousands and thousands and thousands of other people do the same I teach people how to be
(03:09) their own counsel to stand up in courts of Law and be able to exercise their constitutional rights in a timely and
(03:14) effective Manner and the good Lord willing I'll be able to keep doing that so why don't we uh right now try and get
(03:21) into some parts of the Constitution the most important thing that I can teach you about this constitution
(03:28) is the importance of reading it you must read the Constitution and understand
(03:33) what physically is involved you must know your rights and timely assert them that is your burden if you do not then a
(03:41) legal term called latches incurs latches is a legal term which is defined as an
(03:47) as latches as a specie of action where in a party of reasonable intelligence and integrity having a right to take an
(03:54) action as is prescribed by law and having failed to timely do so loses all right to proceed so what is actually
(04:01) happening out there folks is that latches is occurring because most people don't read their constitution and know
(04:07) what's involved so then you are left to being told well that's what it means okay so you just got to do what you got
(04:13) to do and you're told and they're going to tell you in favor of them they're not going to tell you in favor of you so
(04:19) it's better for you to read the book and understand what's in it it's not a very big book I I highly recommend the book
(04:26) I you can get several versions uh a lot of times you contact your Congressman my
(04:31) congressman Dominic vincentini state senator supplied this one for me uh John
(04:36) a Libertarian candidate has supplied several also some of these folks just check with your local uh
(04:43) Congressman or State Rep a lot of times you can they'll just give you one if you cannot find one go down to your United
(04:49) States uh government building here in the Detroit vicinity it's called the McNamara building on the first floor
(04:56) and what we do then is we go into the government printing office I'm usually there about a buck
(05:02) but I highly recommend you go get one I I don't leave home without mine I usually have three or four of them
(05:08) someplace and I hand them out also myself I give them out to whoever I I think one of the most kindest things I
(05:13) can do to a person is given this book and show them how it works this book is kind of like a Genie in a
(05:19) Bottle if you know how to stroke this book I am telling you the genie comes out and it
(05:24) usually with a force that that you it will be clearly recognized in any court and land
(05:30) now that doesn't mean it'll be easy you might have to work a little bit but basically there's an argument and it
(05:36) comes like this if I violate your rights you may or may not know about it if you know about it
(05:42) you may or may not be able to do something about it if you do have an ability to do something about it you may or may not have the financial
(05:47) wherewithal to go to a finished program if you do have the financial wherewithal
(05:53) you may not have the intestinal fortitude to go to a finished program so most of the time your governments and
(05:58) your your abusive Personalities in government or your corporations uh
(06:04) pretty much have carte blanche to to injure you because in 99.9 percent of
(06:10) the cases nobody most people will not proceed but every now and then you run into that one hard nut and he doesn't
(06:16) quit or she doesn't quit till the cows come home and what happens is that person will prevail and those are
(06:22) the people that are actually generating better protections and better constitutional rights for you those are
(06:27) the ones that are going to the Supreme Courts and the courts of appeals and what have you that are pushing that are spending their live funds to allow you
(06:34) to have the benefit but if you aren't there to catch the benefit then you you the benefit is lost so we're going to get right into the
(06:40) Constitution we're going to teach you some things about it pay attention because we're really doing this out of an act of love for you and
(06:47) we're hoping to God you're going to pick up on it and pay attention Okay now I'm going to put one Constitution down
(06:53) here so the folks can see it I will open this up from time to time to demonstrate things to you I will basically try and
(06:59) read out of another Constitution so that we can better show you some of
(07:04) the things that are involved now it's important that you understand that this constitution is in writing
(07:10) it's important that you understand that it is a legal document okay
(07:16) that it was ratified by all of the members in a congress together right
(07:23) and that that document can be you can get all the signatures on the document
(07:29) okay and it's important that you understand that there was an offer government
(07:35) offered to govern there was a consideration the citizens considered how they were going to be governed and
(07:41) government promised that they would govern by Constitution and there was an agreement the citizens agreed that if
(07:47) Government promised there would be a government by Constitution that they would agree to allow the Constitution
(07:52) into Force now there's a unique situation here it's very rare when you
(07:57) find the Friday of the first part which is the congressman officers of the government who are also parties of the second part
(08:04) as representatives of We the People The Republic and when they signed the document they signed the document as
(08:10) officers of government agreeing to the Constitution and simultaneously as officers of Representatives of the
(08:17) people in the Republican form of government and when they signed that document that
(08:23) constituted a Ironclad contract in writing enforceable and court of law
(08:28) pursuant to the statute of frauds here in the state of Michigan that's 566.132 Michigan compile laws act which
(08:35) basically States anything in writing is a forcible in the court of law pursuant to the statute of frauds now all we're
(08:41) asking is that they enforce the contract we want them to enforce the contract in other words if we read something in here
(08:47) and we got a good reason for why we believe it's the way it is then they should honor that and they should honor
(08:54) it in favor of you the query intended and expressly designated beneficiary but I'll get into that a little later article 6 paragraph two of the
(09:00) Constitution this is called the supremacy clause of the Constitution it's located at article 6. anybody see
(09:07) that paragraph two which is going to start right here and I'm going to read it to you okay and basically what it says is
(09:15) this this constitution and the laws of the United States which
(09:20) shall be made in pursuance thereof and the treaties made or which shall be
(09:25) made under the authority of the United States
(09:32) shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound
(09:38) thereby anything in the Constitution or laws of any state
(09:45) to the contrary are notwithstanding when they say notwithstanding that means notwithstanding in law that means that's
(09:50) a legal definition not what standing means and I was standing in law now a very important case Marbury versus
(09:57) Madison 5 U.S 137 it's recorded at volume Five
(10:05) right here it's an 8 19 1803 case Marbury versus Madison it's recorded in
(10:11) volume Five page 137. now basically what this case States and
(10:16) and I'm telling you right now if you want to use a case to cite for any purpose in court you have to read the
(10:22) case if you haven't read the case you haven't read the case and formed a basis upon which a logical determination in
(10:28) your mind could have been reached to form an opinion as to why you should do
(10:34) what you're going to do then the judge will throw your case out so read your cases don't just quote cases because
(10:40) they won't you won't win if the judge ever pins you down and starts asking you some merits of the case and you can't
(10:46) even understand what the case is about nine times out of ten he's just going to throw your case in in the in the can so
(10:52) make sure you read the case this is one of the leading cases in the history of the United States of
(10:59) America the opinion of the Court was given by the honorable Judge John Marshall Chief Justice of the Supreme
(11:05) Court his opinion was anything it is in Conflict his non-on void of law
(11:11) clearly he said that for a secondary law to come in conflict with the supreme law
(11:17) was illogical for certainly the supreme law would Prevail over all other law and
(11:22) certainly our forefathers had intended that the supreme law would be the basis of Allah and for any law to come in
(11:29) Conflict would be null and void of law it would bear no power to enforce it would bear no obligation to obey it
(11:35) would report to settle as if it never existed for unconstitutionality would date from the enactment of such a law
(11:41) not from the date so branded in an open court of law no courts are bound to uphold it and no citizens are bound to
(11:47) obey it it operates as a mere nullity or a fiction of law which means it doesn't exist in law now let me give you an
(11:54) example in today's timing as to how effective this is this argument is so effective that it literally nullifies
(11:59) the Brady Bill it nullifies the crime bill it takes away the right of the people to keep and bear arms on these 19
(12:04) weapons that turn into 159 weapons it stops this 666 bill it just went
(12:12) through that they're trying to take away the Fourth Amendment you see because they have no power to pass a law that's
(12:17) in conflict with the United States Constitution and it's automatically non-emoid of law from its Inception not
(12:22) from the date you go to court and ran it as unconstitutional now I want to get that real clear
(12:27) a lot of people think that they got to go to court and brand it unconstitutional I'm here to tell you if
(12:32) you know your arguments and you can show your arguments most of the time you will win
(12:38) every now and then you run into a hard nose but I'll show you how to deal with him too okay but for now I want
(12:44) everybody that's got a chance to go out to learn your Constitution your article 6 paragraph two of your Constitution I
(12:51) want you to to pay attention to what's going on here learn to read about this Marbury versus Madison Case
(12:58) I want to show you this right here is an example of what is called Shepherd
(13:04) citations Shepherd citations is a group of reporters that go through and keep
(13:09) track of all the court cases that have come before the courts especially the Supreme Court and they clarify before
(13:15) the court all of the cases each one of these little numbers here represents somebody hiring a lawyer and going to
(13:21) the Supreme Court every one of these there's nine pages of these folks almost 200 years worth it goes against
(13:29) this case Marbury versus Madison and I want to tell you this case is
(13:34) still supreme law of land if it wasn't you would see O's in here where it was overturned okay
(13:39) you don't see any O's there aren't any O's that means the case is standing there'd
(13:46) be an o in this column right next to here you don't see any O's because there's no case that could come up against this case That's How Strong this
(13:52) case is folks now this is nine pages each one this is two pages each
(13:58) there's nine pages of this this represents if I was to to try and teach
(14:03) you what this represents if I was building a wall from here to the moon out of bricks
(14:10) that's what that would mean in legal terms because that's how solid this case is so
(14:16) it's very important that you understand your Constitution is an ironclad contract generating enforceable in the
(14:21) court of law it's very important that you understand article 6 paragraph two the supremacy clause which says the Constitution and the laws and pursuance
(14:27) thereof and the treaties made which shall be made under the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land the judges in every state
(14:33) shall be bound thereby anything in conflict or repugnancy is null and void of law it Bears no power to enforce no
(14:40) obligation to obey purports to settle as if it never exists an unconstitutionality dates from the enactment no courts are bound to uphold
(14:45) that no citizens are bound to obey it now that is one of the most important lessons that I can teach you on the Constitution so that you can understand
(14:52) how strong this document is and when I go to the law library and I
(14:57) hit some of these law libraries that's wall-to-wall books folks I mean it's like I take people down there and their chins on the ground and then I tell them
(15:03) there's three floors of this place just like this filled to the brim with books and books and did you know that in every
(15:09) one of those cases this little book right here this one right here folks
(15:14) controls every single book in that law library every single one every single book in that law library is
(15:21) controlled by this little book so can you understand how important it is for you to know what's in this little book so that you can effectively call on that
(15:29) kind of a commanding knowledge okay it is absolutely vital that you get
(15:36) a hold of one of these books and start learning it and don't let anybody take away your constitutional rights
(15:42) you cannot you can't even give your constitution rights away you have to voluntarily acquiesce by signing a
(15:47) document on a Miranda release form that's how hard it is to give away your constitutional rights we don't want you
(15:52) to give away any of your raise we want you to know these rights backward forward upside down another we want you to be able to Rattle them up our
(15:59) soldiers could do it and they did it with with the great love in their heart and the pride and the duty that they hold in their art and
(16:05) they swore on a sacred oath that they defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic and then
(16:10) they perform their duties to the best of their ability so help them God and by God they do both in the service and out of the
(16:16) service okay we defend the Constitution to the death we Never Surrender We Are Soldiers above
(16:23) all and we love our country and our flag and our constitution we are what the the term is under the the military code of
(16:31) conduct I am an American fighting Soldier I serve the forces which guard my country in this constitutional way of government I am prepared to give my life
(16:36) if necessary in defense of that Constitution and that's exactly what we're going to do so I want you to pay attention a lot of
(16:43) brave soldiers have died to pay for this book so that you could have the right and the least you could do for your own
(16:49) self sake is to learn what's in this book and be able to argue effectively what's in this book you would be amazed
(16:55) how many times you can win if you just have this book and know what's in it we're going to go into some other
(17:01) arguments here we're going to try and show you how to really effectively use this book okay now that everybody's got that in hand
(17:09) the next thing we're going to start teaching you is things like about the Second Amendment the Second Amendment is one of the
(17:14) biggies that everybody talks about today and the one that gets railroaded probably the most the next is the fourth amendment in the Fifth Amendment okay
(17:21) but the second amendment is one of the most vital amendments here because our forefathers had such an important
(17:26) understanding of life liberty and pursuit of happiness that was the first amendment that they turned around and
(17:32) realized that without the right to protect that first right they didn't have that right so the Second Amendment
(17:37) they they instituted the right of the people to keep in carry arms and that right shall not be infringed now they
(17:43) started out by seeing a well-regulated militia being necessary for the maintenance of a free state okay
(17:49) isn't that a true statement folks a well-regulated militia is necessary for the security of a free state that's just
(17:55) a true statement so is oranges are orange that's why they call them oranges okay but that doesn't have any legal
(18:01) precedence in theory the most important part about that second amendment is it says the right of
(18:06) the people and the Supreme Court has ruled in hundreds of cases that whenever it says the right of the people it means the
(18:12) right each of every single citizen to possess the right equally now a lot of guys like to hand out this
(18:18) Manola that well that's a collective right you got to be a member of the militia that's all who done you don't
(18:24) have to be a member of a militia you all you have to do is be an American you have the right the right to keep in carry arms and that
(18:31) right shall not be in French now you will know it after in Fringe there is no sub paragraph a b c d e f g which would
(18:40) stipulate as to what would be an acceptable infringement
(18:45) so all infringement is forbidden now who says so you say so
(18:51) do you see that does everybody see that you say so who are you I'm an American
(18:57) and I'm telling you you're infringing my rights you're stealing my rights I I claim infringement I claim encroachment
(19:03) I claim impingement I claim use a patient I claim you're stealing my right because that's what they're doing
(19:09) and I ask them what is it you don't understand about the word infringement because that's exactly what it says when you look in Black slaw dictionary that's
(19:15) another thing I want to bring up and you want to talk to these people in
(19:20) court you want to get a hold of one of these books right here
(19:26) it's called Black's Law Dictionary you would be absolutely amazed
(19:31) what's in Black's Law Dictionary this is the exact words that you need
(19:39) to be able to definitively Define the word game problem that we are Hamming with these people today they
(19:45) like to keep changing the words but guess what the words in this book are the words that were written when we
(19:51) were in the Constitution when it was signed and the definitions that are in this book are enforceable in a court of law
(19:57) you can bring this book into court and pull it open and say this is the one judge and they guts to listen
(20:03) and that's the way it is so for sure if you're going to be in this go down to one of your bookstores uh
(20:10) whichever you may have in your area Barnes and Noble or any one of the dozens of decent
(20:17) bookstores and get a copy of Black's Law Dictionary you need that to be in this because this is kind of like
(20:23) defining the map of how to get from A to B you have to have this book to be able to pull it out so you can turn around
(20:30) and tell them hey don't trample my rights I take it real
(20:35) damn you today good book you can pick up on the Constitution is this
(20:41) this American Constitution put out by West Publishing Company
(20:46) this goes into a whole lot of widened arguments as to your
(20:52) Constitution now after I'm finished talking to you you're going to have a new concept of Constitution and how it works you're going to understand that
(20:58) it's what you say it is if you got an honest trade and I'll give you a perfect example now the First
(21:04) Amendment basically talks about the right of life liberty and pursuit of happiness right that isn't the right to work part of
(21:10) right of life liberty and pursuit of happiness got a right to work right contract your labor your skill in your
(21:15) time of life is you see fit right so that makes sense to you that's the First Amendment right another First Amendment
(21:21) right would be the right to travel freely unencumbered see no State can require you to have a
(21:27) license to travel freely uncomfort and we'll go into that and show you how that is is taken care of okay
(21:34) the bottom line is you need to learn as much as you absolutely possibly can in
(21:39) the shortest possible time about your Constitution because I'm telling you right now as we speak they are trying to
(21:44) curtail that Constitution and take away rights that you have that have been given to you from your forefathers there's only one thing that's going to
(21:50) stop that well maybe two there's two things the first thing that's going to stop that if all of us get together get
(21:56) a hold of one of these books and start shaking and say whoa I see we're not letting you take away that Constitution
(22:03) this is America we got an American flag on a pool out front last time I checked this is United
(22:09) States of America we got a constitution here and you ain't touching that Constitution so you call up that bill McCullum in
(22:15) Washington and you tell him he's the guy that sponsored that 666 Bill to take away the Fourth Amendment right to have
(22:21) a search warrant you get a hold of them and I'll give you his number later on in the speech here
(22:26) and you call that joker up and you say Sir what is it you don't understand about your oath above us we kind of like you to leave the Constitution alone
(22:32) matter of fact we'd like you to make it stronger than it is not take nothing away from it period
(22:38) and we resent the hell out of you taking an oath of office to protect the Constitution and we put you in office
(22:44) and the first thing you do when you get in there is try and Scuttle the Constitution and flush it down the toilet we're not going to put up with that stuff we want you to understand
(22:50) that real clearly the second way we can do it is if
(22:55) necessary and proper are malicious can come together and decide to tell these people that are given Aid and comfort to
(23:00) the enemies of our country by breaking down our laws that you have broken the law of Title 18 United States code section 2381 which says that in the
(23:07) presence of two witnesses to the same overreact or in an open court of law if you fail the timely move to protect and defend the Constitution of the United
(23:13) States and honor your oath of office you are subject to the charge of capital felony treason and upon conviction you will be taken by the policy to the
(23:19) nearest disease intersection in a hayenunang by the negative dead the body to remain in state until dusk as an
(23:25) example to anyone who take the role of all was lightly you see without that all the Bible's this constitution is worthless
(23:31) that's why we have you take that oath of office so that we know you will honor the south of office and that you will
(23:36) keep our constitution we don't want anybody taking our constitution away and we're here to tell you right now don't do it
(23:42) we'll take a damn view of it we probably will charge you and we're not fooling around
(23:48) okay now let's get into some other things in the Constitution the bottom line here is you have to know
(23:55) to be able to exercise your Constitution the most important parts about your Constitution are in your first 10
(24:01) amendments okay obviously the rate of the people to keep in carry arms shall not be
(24:07) infringed and that right shall not be infringed you must claim you're right if you want
(24:14) to have it you have to be willing to do that and if they are going to take your right then
(24:19) you have to be willing to challenge them whatever it costs now the bottom line is any law that comes in conflict with that
(24:26) what do we talk about in article 6 paragraph two if any law shall come in conflict with this the supreme law what
(24:33) happens it's non-voidable law it Bears no power to enforce no obligation to obey purports to settle as if it never
(24:39) exists in unconstitutionality dates from the enactment of such a law not from any date so Brandon Northern court of law so
(24:44) what happened to the Brady Bill folks canceled due to lack of Interest okay
(24:50) what happened to the crying bill with the gun infringements if any portion of the bill be unconstitutional the whole
(24:56) bill is unconstitutional because why repugnancy okay
(25:02) it's repugnant to the United States Constitution it's non-emoid of law it Bears no power to enforce no obligation no babe reports the settles that never
(25:08) existed which case said so Marbury versus Madison 5us 137 1803
(25:13) that's how important that case is that's why you got to go down to your law library and read
(25:20) okay so Marbury versus Madison is extremely important it's important to be able to read the case understand what
(25:26) they're talking about now other cases that are involved are your
(25:32) rights to Due Process like under your fourth and fifth and sixth amendments right the right of the people to be
(25:38) secure in their houses the right of the people to be secure in their person houses papers and effects
(25:44) against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrant shall issue but upon probable
(25:51) cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the person or things to
(25:56) be seized and obviously that would imply that would imply
(26:01) that would imply that judge and said this is the guy he did it this is the crime that was done and this
(26:08) is the evidence we're looking for judge and we'd like to get a warrant and we're swearing on everything we told Jesus of God's truth and then they can come over
(26:14) and ain't search till Hell Freezes Over okay does that sound logical to you no that's
(26:19) what Bill 666 is trying to throw out they don't want you to have that right anymore now it's important for you to
(26:25) immediately jump to the Ninth Amendment what does the Ninth Amendment say enumeration in this constitution of
(26:31) certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people now basically what that means in
(26:36) simplest of terms Congress has no authority to add on to the constitution in such a way that would take away
(26:43) rights previously guaranteed what seems to be Mr mccollum's problem does he not read The King's English
(26:51) excuse me simply spoken he has no authority to
(26:56) pass this 666 Bill the Congress had no authority to pass this Brady Bill
(27:02) they had no authority to pass this crime bill because it clearly infringed on the United States Constitution I don't care
(27:08) how nobly issue it was I don't care how learned the people claim to be
(27:14) they weren't learned enough because if they were learning they would have understood the Ninth Amendment
(27:20) forbids adding on to the Constitution by any laws whatsoever that takes away rights that are previously guaranteed
(27:25) let's go on let's hit the 10th Amendment Powers not delegated to the United
(27:32) States what is this what are they talking about here the power is not delegated to the United States by the
(27:38) Constitution nor prohibited by it to the states
(27:45) are reserved to the states respectfully or to the people see this is a limited contract
(27:51) this contract is designed to limit government and when you get into your police power
(27:57) as you start understanding your police Powers almost you'll hear this all the time well we have police Powers Broad
(28:04) and sweeping police Powers you look up black slaw dictionary and police Powers it says the law of imminent domain of a state or political subdivision you enact
(28:10) laws for the common good and Welfare in a curb crime and in great big black letters it says within constitutional limitations see the Tenth Amendment well
(28:16) when they're talking about see the Tenth Amendment this is the tenth amendment they're talking about now do they have powers to take away
(28:23) previous rates guaranteed under the Constitution the answer is obviously no they don't obviously the Ninth Amendment sets a
(28:30) clear limit on that what is it these guys don't understand about their constitution they pass these Brady bills they pass
(28:37) these crime bills they pass these 666 bills to take away your Fourth Amendment right requiring a search warrant what is
(28:43) it that they don't understand about the lacks on the Constitution now do you see how wise our forefathers were they knew
(28:49) they knew history and they knew that history repeats itself if people forget
(28:56) so what they did is they set a standard very importantly toward the end of the contract that
(29:02) clearly stipulated exactly what limits would be there
(29:07) you see and it clearly stipulated that no power has existed to take away rights that
(29:13) were previously guaranteed so how therefore is this being done I'll tell you how it's being done
(29:19) because they wants to and they're not doing it my law now why are they getting away with it
(29:25) because most of the people don't know any better and if you don't know your rights and you don't timely assert them latches and curse latches being a specie
(29:33) of action we're in a party of reasonable intelligence and integrity having a right to take an action as is prescribed by law and having failed to timely do so
(29:41) loses our right to proceed so by you acquiescing by not jumping up and saying hey
(29:47) Hold the Line Chester you ain't touching that Fourth Amendment you aren't touching that second amendment
(29:54) we're not putting up with that stuff you took an oath of office we're going to hold you to it you violate that old of office we're going to charge you with
(29:59) capital felony trees and under Title 18 United States Gold section 2381. what difference does it make if they're an
(30:05) open Rebellion against the United States or if they're breaking down the laws creating the Rebellion isn't that giving
(30:11) Aiden Comfort to the enemies of our country it most certainly is and it's called sedition trees and mice Edition
(30:18) okay now we got to start coloring these guys and telling them hey what is it you
(30:24) don't understand about the constitution in your oval of office we're going to clearly correct that in the short interim if you don't want to fix it we
(30:30) will remove you and that's our duty and our responsibility now when Benjamin
(30:37) Franklin walked out of all of the hearings to set up this constitution a lady reporter walked up to him and asked
(30:43) him what is it we have now and he turned to her and told her we
(30:48) have a republic if we can keep it obviously the burden is on us to make
(30:54) sure we keep it so I'm asking you to get a hold of one of these constitutions and let's plan on keeping it
(31:00) all right now let's get into some more of the arguments on the Constitution your fifth amendment let's pull up your
(31:07) fifth amendment no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise Infamous crime unless on the presentment
(31:13) or indictment of a grand jury accepting cases arising in the land or Naval forces or in the militia when an actual
(31:19) service and time of War or public danger nor shall any person be
(31:24) subject to the same offense be twice put in Jeopardy that's the double jeopardy statue of life or limb nor shall be
(31:31) compelled in any crime criminal case to be a witness against himself that's a self-incrimination defense nor be
(31:37) deprived of life liberty or property without due process alone that's your equal protection clause
(31:43) you have an equal right to all of all of your rights under the law and you have a right to Due Process a law matter of
(31:48) fact if they don't give you due process allow title V United States code section 556-d is clear and specific and it says
(31:55) if they deny a due process of the law all jurisdiction ceases automatically that's that's title five United States
(32:01) code section 556-d also 557 and section 706 of that code in other words if they
(32:07) deny you due process at any time and you can prove it you can you can force a showdown and you can turn around and say
(32:13) well they might have had jurisdiction at one time judge but they lost it when I denied me due process all right now
(32:21) the other part sorry you cannot deny them life liberty property without due process alone or shell private property
(32:26) be taken for public use without just compensation you know how many times do you hear about that today I mean it's
(32:31) incredible the sixth amendment is another important one all of them are important but there
(32:37) are more important ones all right and all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speed in
(32:42) public trial by an impartial jury of the state and District where in the crime shall have been committed which district
(32:49) shall have been previously as ascertained by law and to be informed of the nature and the cause of the action
(32:55) and accusation to be confronted with the witnesses against him that's the right to confront your accusers to have
(33:02) compulsory process for obtaining Witnesses in your favor that's the subpoena rights and to have the
(33:07) assistance of counsel for your defense or you can stand as your own counsel and I know they tell you that it's a fool
(33:12) that stands as his own Council but it's my argument that it's a fool that doesn't because I'll tell you why you know your
(33:18) case better than you better than anybody how many times do you hear about grapes between attorneys and the citizens the
(33:24) biggest gripe they have was well he never said nothing about that or she never said nothing about that well she didn't do this or she didn't do that
(33:30) well why because they don't know the case as good as you do you're the one that knows your best case the only thing
(33:35) they know is how to apply the law so all I'm telling you is learn how to apply the law in your constitutional rights and then you don't need to do that
(33:42) the only time you get into trouble is if you run your mouth too much and you get into self-incrimination so obviously you
(33:48) have to keep your wits about you and watch your mouth but the bottom line is actually I personally believe you're the best
(33:54) person to present the facts of your case because you're the best person that
(33:59) knows all the facts the only thing you do not know how to do is how to actually do it in a legal and lawful manner that
(34:07) is recognized by the legal community and that's really not hard to learn I can teach you believe me
(34:13) all right the Seventh Amendment in suits at the common law where the value and controversy show exceed twenty
(34:19) dollars or write a trial by Jerry shall be preserved and no fact Tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any
(34:25) Court of the United States because the jury is the ultimate driver effect then according to the rules of the
(34:31) common law now we'll get into that common law argument there's a lot of heavy arguments around that common law
(34:37) basically I don't want to overwhelm you on the first time out of the shoot because that's not hard to do okay
(34:45) now the bottom line of this constitution is it's all in writing
(34:50) it clearly represents a contract I'm asking you to learn your contract I'm asking you to learn the book
(34:58) learn your contract I mean when you go to some place to do some work on your car you read the document that comes
(35:04) with it for the warranty don't you why because just in case something goes wrong you want to be able to bring it
(35:09) back right well I'm asking you to read the warranty on your Constitution so that you can understand the rights that you have
(35:16) under that Constitution so that if you don't get it right we can bring it back does that make sense to
(35:21) you all right now it's also important that you understand
(35:27) this constitution is a very unique document that this constitution is supposed to be
(35:34) enforced and I'm gonna teach you some things here right now this right here is a representation I
(35:42) know it's kind of hard to see here but basically what we're talking about here is this comes from the books that tell
(35:49) the judge how right here and over here this comes and
(35:55) tells the judge how the Constitution is to be interpreted this is from the
(36:01) amgurus Prudence volumes and this is volume 16. you want the Constitutional law section
(36:07) right here constitutional law and you want section 97
(36:13) and when you start reading it the most important part about it and I'll read it is that a constitution should really
(36:18) should receive a liberal interpretation in favor of the citizen is especially true with respect to those Provisions
(36:24) which were designed to safeguard the liberty and security of the citizen in regard to both person and property can
(36:31) you see that can y'all see that is that coming up right here over more okay all right to safeguard the liberty and
(36:38) security of the citizen in regard to both person and property C note 31 rise versus United States 273 us 28 and all
(36:45) of these 40 Supreme Court cases hold that axle in other words it's supposed to be
(36:51) liberally enforced in favor of the citizen for the protection rights and property any constitutional provision
(36:56) intended to confer a benefit should be liberally construed in favor of the clearly intended and expressly
(37:02) designated beneficiary 32 but on 32 de Jammer versus Hospital authority of
(37:08) Albany in all of these cases okay
(37:13) I'm just trying to tell you you can go look this up and you can better see it let's do that over again in a
(37:19) constitutional provision intended to confer a benefit should be liberally construed in favor of the clearly intended and especially designated
(37:25) beneficiary similarly a provision intended to afford a remedy to those who
(37:31) have just claims should receive a beneficial construction for the purpose of extending the remedy to all
(37:39) who might fairly come within the meaning of the terms and that's writer versus fitchie of Ohio
(37:46) a Supreme Court case okay that's note number 33. okay
(37:53) now this comes out of 16 dangerous Prudence in other words I have this constitution
(37:59) this constitution is a contract in writing enforceable in the court of law pursuant to the statute of frauds I'm
(38:05) asking for specific performance your honor in favor of me I am the beneficiary of the contract
(38:11) there's also a basic premise in contract law basic contract law 101 of any first year law student that says the contract
(38:18) shall be enforced most favorably in favor of the non-preparer
(38:24) and that's you you didn't prepare it now if you believe honestly that you
(38:31) have a right and you can timely bring that right before a proper adjudicated Authority and you can clearly stipulate
(38:38) as to what your rate was guess what they got us to listen that's the way it is that's the way it's supposed to be
(38:43) and I'm telling you if you know your rights and your timely circles right you have those rights but if you sit on your
(38:49) haunches and you cry out that's terrible somebody ought to do something about that hey be a somebody
(38:56) do something about it don't sit there telling me there's somebody ought to do something about that be with somebody you do something about it you honestly
(39:02) got an honest you go out there and you take care of it because that's what it takes to be an American that's what all that's what
(39:08) it's all about that's what being an American is all about that's what separates you from the rest of the whole world because Americans you don't trample on
(39:14) their rights because they're going to come get you you do not trample on their rights they won't put up with it so be an American
(39:20) and don't put up with it stand up there and be counted now I want to read the next argument there which is argument
(39:25) numbers 98 which basically deals with the effect of an emergency argument 98 while an
(39:33) emergency cannot create power and no emergency justifies the violation of any of the provisions of the United States
(39:39) Constitution or state constitutions public emergencies such as economic
(39:44) depression for especially liberal construction of Constitutional Powers and it has been
(39:50) declared that because of national exigency it is the policy of the courts and Times of national apparel so
(39:56) liberally to construe the special powers vested in the chief executive as to sustain and effectuate the purpose
(40:02) thereof and to that end also more liberally to construe the constituted Division and classification of the
(40:09) powers of the co-ordinate branches of the government and insofar as may not be clearly inconsistent
(40:15) with the Constitution right in other words it can't be in conflict with the Constitution to vest extraordinary
(40:22) powers in the chief executive and I'm telling you on the other hand a contention that a grave emergency such
(40:28) as the depression should permit construction of the Constitutional Provisions which would meet the emergency was rejected in one case the
(40:35) court holding that neither the legislature nor any executive or judicial officer may disregard the
(40:40) provisions of the constitution in cases of an emergency where the plain and unequivocable terms
(40:46) of the Constitution present to question of construction as to departures in emergencies so not even an emergency
(40:52) justifies the taken away of constitutional provisions and I know you've heard differently I know you think well they got an emergency they
(40:59) just declined an emergency and then the president issues an executive order but let me ask you if it's a republican
(41:04) Constitution of the United States is it the law no who says so we do we're the people it's
(41:11) our country it's our constitution we're the ones that say you can't do that and we mean it you've been a little better
(41:17) listen all right now let's get into the next argument here now I hope I'm not boring you to tears
(41:24) here but it's kind of important that we cover these basic things so that you can understand as to the construction ref with
(41:31) reference to the common law an important Canon of construction is that that constitutions must be construed with
(41:38) reference to the common law that means the law of the little people out there not the corporations
(41:45) okay since in most respects the federal and state constitutions did not
(41:50) repudiate but cherish the established common law this fact has been taken into consideration by the courts and
(41:57) construing certain Clauses in a state constitution such as the provision securing their right to a jury trial
(42:03) also Provisions in regard to crimes have been interpreted with reference to the common law rule that one
(42:11) that one charge for the crime may be convicted of a lesser offense necessarily included in the crime charge
(42:17) in such cases the courts of the state always regard the language in the common law sense so the common law prevails
(42:24) don't let anybody tell you this admiralty law prevails because it only prevails of you to get sucked into it
(42:30) we're not going to let you do that we're going to teach you how to beat it the common law also permitted destruction of
(42:36) the abatement of nuisances by summary proceedings traffic tickets folks
(42:42) that's what a traffic ticket does it is a writ of assistance a bill of attainer
(42:47) it's unlawful in the United States of America and it was never supposed that a
(42:52) constitutional provision was intended to interfere with this established principle and although there is no
(42:59) common law of the United States in the sense who said so Erie Railroad versus Tompkins okay
(43:06) all right of a National customary law as distinguished
(43:12) from the common law of England adopted into several States in interpreting the Federal Constitution
(43:18) recourse may still be had to the aid of the common law of England
(43:23) it has been said that without reference to this common law the language of the
(43:29) Federal Constitution could not be understood all right so the common law applies
(43:34) folks and we're going to get into that common law heavily in the advanced section all right
(43:40) okay now let's get back into this in interpreting the Federal Constitution adopted by the several States all right
(43:47) the recourse may still be had to the aid of the common law of England it has been
(43:53) said that without reference to the common law the language of the United States Constitution would not be
(44:00) understood this is due to the fact that this instrument and the plan of government of the United States were
(44:06) founded on the common law as established in England at the time of the Revolution okay therefore it is the general rule
(44:13) that the phrases in the Bill of Rights taken from the common law must be construed in reference to the latter
(44:19) specifically the United States Supreme Court has taken that the common law into consideration in construing the Fourth
(44:26) Amendment the Fifth Amendment Provisions relating all right so the common law is extremely important that we get in and
(44:31) we will cover that thoroughly it's important to understand that most of you out there aren't citizens at the common
(44:37) law that only only those that understand the differences in admiralty and maritime
(44:42) law those that are corporations officers of Corporations there's officers of government residing in the District of
(44:48) Columbia the 14th Amendment duality of citizenship which is talked about in the case of Erie Railroad versus Tompkins
(44:54) which is a rather heavy argument and I will cover that thoroughly with you so that you understand where the traps and
(45:00) the differences are but for right now I'm trying to demonstrate to you construction and programming so that you can understand that this constitution
(45:06) right here is the supreme law of the land it is a contract in writing it is
(45:12) enforceable in favor of you in an open court of law you are the beneficiary okay I want to give you some basic more
(45:18) points on this amjurisprudence argument this is section 114 of the 16th volume of amjuries period in a second I'm going
(45:25) to give you a couple more of these sites so that you can understand how powerful a document this is okay by the way I
(45:31) highly recommend you go down to the law library grab that 16 volume amjurisprudence
(45:36) start at section one and start paging through to section 300 you will absolutely be astounded
(45:42) we are now in 16th amgurus Prudence second section 117.
(45:47) and I will read it to you basically various facts and circumstances extrinsic to the Constitution are often
(45:54) resorted to by the courts to Aid them in determining its meaning as previously
(45:59) noted however such extrinsic AIDS may not be resorted to where the provision
(46:06) in the question is clear and unambiguous in such a case
(46:12) the courts must apply the terms of the Constitution as written and they are not at Liberty to search
(46:19) for meanings beyond the instrument which that militia argument and that
(46:24) Collective law theory of the Second Amendment is they're reaching they're reaching far
(46:29) all right clearly it says in the plain English the right of the people to keep and carry
(46:36) arms shall not be infringed now what is it you don't understand about the word infringed
(46:43) infringement 1968 gun control act it's infringent all of these uh the CCW acts
(46:50) of these States they're infringen who says so you do how shall a document be enforced in
(46:55) favor of who you when are you going to enforce it you're the one that is the the citizen
(47:02) all power is inherent in the people you're the one with the power enforce your power all right does everybody understand that argument
(47:09) that's the magnificence I'm bringing the genie out we're stroking the bottle here and I'm going to bring the genie out
(47:15) here in a second you're going to understand the magnificence of the power of this book
(47:21) you see once you understand this is an ironclad contract once you understand that this is enforceable in the court of
(47:27) law pursuant to the statute of frauds once you understand you have a right to claim specific performance on the contract your honor I'm demanding my
(47:33) right to keep and carry arms and that right shall not be infringed I want specific performance I am the holder of
(47:38) the contract it's supposed to be enforced in favor of me I am the clearly intended any specially designated beneficiary to citizen I want the thing
(47:45) protected in favor of my right does that make logical sense to you now
(47:50) and you start to understand the power of this document okay see before you just
(47:55) thought it was a bunch of riding in some in some textbook that you had to take when you took a civics class in high
(48:01) school in the 11th grade see I want you to understand that you don't leave home without this this is more important than your credit card
(48:08) okay next let's get into the next section I'm going to cover some more of these amgurus Prudence sections so that you
(48:14) can understand I want to get into uh section 155.
(48:21) 16 damages prudent second section 155. since the Constitution is intended for
(48:27) the observance of the Judiciary as well as other Departments of government and the judges are sworn to prove to support
(48:33) its Provisions dad me sworn as an oval of a sworn the courts are not at Liberty to
(48:39) overlook or disregard its commands or counternance evasions
(48:47) thereof it is their Duty in authorized proceedings to give full effect to the
(48:53) existing Constitution and to obey all constitutional Provisions irrespective of their opinion as to the wisdom or the
(49:01) desirability of such provisions and irrespective of the consequences thus it
(49:06) is said that the courts should be in our alert to enforce the provisions of the
(49:12) United States Constitution and guard against their infringement my legislative Fiat or otherwise in
(49:21) accordance with these basic principles the rule is fixed that the duty in the proper case to declare a long
(49:27) constitutional cannot be declined and must be performed in accordance with
(49:35) the deliberate Judgment of the tribunal before which the validity of the enactment is directly drawn into
(49:40) question if the Constitution prescribes one rule and the statute another and a
(49:45) different rule it is the duty of the courts to declare that the Constitution and not the statute governs in cases
(49:53) before them for judgment does everybody understand that he's they're telling the judge you gotta rule
(50:00) in favor of the Constitution and if you know your Constitution whose favor are they going to rule in
(50:06) yours but you have to have enough hair on your tail feather to walk in there and say hey
(50:11) I'm an American and I have a constitutional right that right shall not be infringed and you're
(50:17) infringing and I'm asking you not to do that because it's not nice and I'm asking the judge to do his duty
(50:24) under a Smirnoff of office and uphold the United States Constitution as he swore he would under article 11
(50:29) paragraph one in this state which says that he shall Swear to protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies
(50:35) foreign and domestic and evil performance duties to the best of his ability so help him God no let's get closer to so help him God
(50:42) [Music] let's get into another one of these we got a load of them folks so let's bear
(50:47) with me here 16th am jurispruden second section 177.
(50:53) declaratory judgments declaratory judgment actions have often been utilized to test the
(50:59) constitutionality of a statute in government practices the uniform declaratory judgments act makes specific
(51:05) provisions of the determination of construction or validity of statutes in Municipal ordinance by declaratory
(51:11) judgment and is considered to furnish a particularly appropriate method for the
(51:16) determination of controversies relative to the construction and validity of the statutes
(51:22) and of ordinances the federal declaratory judgment act although it does not mention declare declarations as
(51:29) to the construction or validity of the statutes has been invoked frequently as a means of us saying the
(51:35) constitutionality of congressional legislation a plaintiff can have a declaratory judgment action on the
(51:42) constitutionality of either the federal or state statute by a single federal judge
(51:47) so long as he does not ask to have the operation of the statute and joined you
(51:53) can enjoin a constitutional right a court May Grant declaratory relief
(51:59) unless there is a case of controversy before the court that is the dispute must consist of specific adverse claims
(52:05) based upon present rather than future or speculative facts on which to base the adjudication all right I'm trying to
(52:13) tell you folks here you have a right to demand a declaratory judgment which we are going to do in several of our cases here and they got to declare is it
(52:21) constitutional or isn't it constitutional if it's constitutional it has to be judged in favor of who you
(52:27) that a citizen why because you're the beneficiary it's supposed to be enforced and pay review the beneficiary the
(52:33) citizen for the protection rights and property see Byers versus United States 273 us 28. and the 40 Supreme Court
(52:39) cases that support that mandate okay now let's get there's just a couple more here bear with me I know you're probably
(52:45) bored to tears right now but I don't want you to do that I want you to pay attention [Music] okay we're at section 255.
(52:55) 16th amateur is Prudence section 255. in all instances where the court exercises
(53:00) its power to invalidate legislation on constitutional grounds the conflict of the statute with the Constitution must
(53:07) be irreconcilable the Brady Bill irreconcilable huh in other words the
(53:14) court is without authority to declare a statute unconstitutional unless it is in positive or direct conflict with the
(53:21) statute or with the Constitution thus a statute is not to be declared
(53:28) unconstitutional unless so inconsistent with the Constitution they cannot be enforced without a violation thereof
(53:34) because that would be violating the Constitution we can't have that what happened in Marbury versus Madison 5 yes
(53:39) 137 same thing a clear incompatibility between law and the Constitution must exist before the
(53:46) Judiciary is Justified in holding the law unconstitutional this principle is of course in line with the rule that
(53:52) doubts as to constitutionality should be resolved in favor of the constitutionality
(53:59) and the beneficiary you the citizen for the protection your rights and property okay does everybody pick up on that no
(54:07) let's let's shift to 256. 256 right here
(54:13) the general rule is that an unconstitutional statute whether federal or state though having the form and name
(54:19) of law is in reality no law but is Holy void and ineffective for any purpose since
(54:27) unconstitutionality dates from the time of the enactment are not merely from the date of the decision
(54:33) so bringing it wouldn't it be interesting if 34 34 where's 34
(54:40) there's 35 right here's 34. State X rail versus nuyan V Greer but I'll tell you
(54:46) what Marbury versus Madison comes higher than that okay all right 34. let's cover that again and ineffective for any
(54:53) purpose since the unconstitutionality dates from the time of the enagment and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it an unconstitutional law
(55:00) in legal contemplation is as inoperative as if it never had been passed the Brady Bill the crime bill
(55:07) the 1968 gun control Bill all these bills such a statute leaves the question
(55:13) that it purports to settle just as it would be had the statute not ever been
(55:19) enacted no repeal of an enactment is necessary since an unconstitutional law is void
(55:25) the general principles follows that it imposes no duties confers no rights creates no office bestows no power or
(55:30) authority on anyone affords no protection and justifies no acts performed under it a contract did
(55:36) everybody pick up on that keyword contract a contract which arrests on an
(55:42) unconstitutional statute creates no obligation to be impaired by
(55:47) subsequent legislation no one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law no courts are bound to enforce it persons
(55:53) convicted and fined under a statute subsequently have unconstitutional May recover the fines paid a void act cannot
(55:59) be legally inconsistent with a valid one and an unconstitutional law cannot operate to supersede an existing valid
(56:04) law indeed insofar as a statute runs counter to the fundamental law of the land the Constitution it is superseded
(56:12) thereby since an unconstitutional statute cannot repeal or in any way affect an existing one if a repealing
(56:18) statute is unconstitutional the statute which it attempts to repeal remains in full force in effect and wear a cloak
(56:25) well what did I say there I mean remains in full force in effect is the second amendment in full force in effect you
(56:30) better believe it okay now what is it they don't understand about in Fringe and where statute which
(56:36) it attempts to repeal remains a full force and effect and where a clause repealing a prayer law is Insurgent in
(56:42) the ACT which act is unconstitutional avoid the provision of the repeal of the prior law will usually fall with it and
(56:50) will not be permitted to operate as repealing such prior law in other words the law stands always the real law the
(56:56) Constitution the general principle stated above apply to the Constitutions as well as to the laws of several States
(57:02) and so far as they are repugnant to the Constitution and the laws of the United States and let's see if 54 will confer
(57:10) human versus Barry but I can tell you Marbury versus Madison is higher than that but I'd be willing to better lay
(57:15) cited Marbury in that moreover a constitution of a statute
(57:21) a construction of a statute which brings in conflict with a constitution will
(57:26) nullify it as effectively as if it had in its expressed term has been enacted in Conflict there with so anything
(57:34) passed in conflict with the United States Constitution is clearly unconstitutional it doesn't take a
(57:39) college professor graduating Magnum loudly from Harvard to figure these things out all you have to do is read that's why
(57:46) God gave you eyes now the actual existence well let's go to 257 257 same book 16 hamster is prudence
(57:54) the actual existence of a statute priority determination that it is unconstitutional is and in as is an
(58:01) operative fact and may have consequences which cannot justify
(58:07) being ignored when a statute which has been in effect for some time is declared
(58:12) unconstitutional questions of Rights claim to have become vested of status
(58:18) of Prior determinations deemed to have finality and acted upon accordingly of
(58:23) priority terminations deemed to have finale enacted upon accordingly and of public policy in the light of the nature
(58:29) both of the statute and of its previous application demand examination
(58:35) all right it has been said that in all-inclusive statement of the
(58:41) principle of absolute retroactive invalidity cannot be justified obviously it would be exposed facto an
(58:47) unconstitutional statute is not necessarily a novelty it may have indeterminate consequences binding upon
(58:54) the people all right so you have to pay attention to what's going on now let's get a few more and we're out
(59:00) of here section 258 I'm just going to read the important section here on the other hand
(59:07) it is clear that Congress cannot buy authorization or ratification give the slightest effect to a state law or
(59:13) Constitution which is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States it would be what a nominee why because it's
(59:21) in conflict of repugnancy it'd be in violation of Marbury versus Madison all right so are you starting to see the
(59:26) gist of what's going on here there's just one more I think and we're out of here all right section 260 of the same 16th
(59:32) amgurus Prudence now folks head down to the law library the books are usually green or red in
(59:38) color they're kind of thick ask the librarian where amgurus Prudence second is stored one over there grab the 16
(59:44) volume start at section one and just start paging through to say section 300 I'm telling you you won't believe it
(59:50) we're going to look at section 260. although it is Manifest in an unconstitutional provision in the
(59:56) statute is not cured because included in the same act with valid provisions and
(1:00:03) that there are no degrees of constitutionality in other words it's either constitutional or it's unconstitutional there's nothing like
(1:00:09) kind of like half pregnant there's no such thing right so that an act is either constitutional
(1:00:16) or it is unconstitutional okay so if you got statute here and most of it's
(1:00:21) constitutional and a part of its unconstitutional guess what it's all unconstitutional so what we got here is a crime bill and
(1:00:29) we got part of it as constitutional and part of it's unconstitutional obviously they had no Authority Under the Second Amendment to fool around with the right
(1:00:35) of the people to keep in their arms they couldn't demand that the people not possess certain firearms
(1:00:40) so this directly applies to this crime bill obviously part of the bill was
(1:00:46) constitutional in the other part is not constitutional so what is the end result the whole bill is unconstitutional does everybody see that now I want you to
(1:00:53) start looking at these things and I want you to start hammering these guys and know what these guys pull this kind of stuff hook them
(1:00:59) over there in column say uh hey Charlie let's step over here for a minute I'm gonna check out something
(1:01:04) here I mean you would if they had your wallet when you that make sense to you now
(1:01:12) we're going to get into a new unique argument here for the last half hour I've been trying
(1:01:17) to hammer home the power of this book this book right here okay I'm trying to
(1:01:24) hammer home the power of this book to teach you that this is the most valuable book in your
(1:01:30) whole life if you know what's in this book I am telling you you are in full possession of your
(1:01:38) American citizenship if you don't know what's in this book I am telling you you're going to be a slave subject to
(1:01:46) the whim of extrajudicial people who want to tell you what to do when to do it how to do it and how how to pack
(1:01:53) now my honest philosophy to you is as a kindness and a Christian to you I tell you learn this book I love it when these
(1:02:00) guys tell me I don't have any rights I said well if you believe that let's go to court
(1:02:05) and on the end of the day we'll see who owns who but I'm going to tell you right now if you violate any of my constitutional
(1:02:11) rights I will sue your socks off and I will attach everything you own Bank business and home
(1:02:17) and I'm telling you I'm the one your mama warned you about so you damn well better listen
(1:02:22) do not violate my rights because I will come after you and I will take care of
(1:02:27) business and I will do what is necessary and proper and I will pull every stop out and I will go dig up every nut bolt
(1:02:32) screw and when it's done you will find out you mess with the wrong American because this American is not going to
(1:02:38) back down okay now we're going to get into a real special argument now this argument has taken almost 18 and a half
(1:02:45) years to develop so I want you to pay attention this argument is a unique concept that has been honed like a razor
(1:02:52) to a very meticulous Edge so that you can understand what's going on obviously we have established clearly that you
(1:02:58) have a constitutional right and obviously we have established that you are the beneficiary of the contract and
(1:03:03) we have established that the constitution is a contract in writing enforceable in the court of law and we have established that you have a right
(1:03:09) to claim specific performance on the contract and we have established that it's supposed to be interpreted in your favor
(1:03:15) so if you got an honest constitutional belief they have to listen now let's take that to the next step
(1:03:21) the next step is can a state arbitrary neuronically convert your right into a provision issue a license and a fee for
(1:03:27) it let's start start with here we're going to start walking down this sheet okay
(1:03:33) Murdoch versus Pennsylvania U.S Supreme Court now when you want to go into the law library and you want to look up
(1:03:39) something what you want to do is understand that
(1:03:44) Supreme Court is Trump okay that's the clearest way I can explain it to you if
(1:03:50) you've got a Supreme Court case that trumps a a district court that Trump's a court of appeals that Trump's the state
(1:03:56) court that trumps everything so you want to deal with Supreme Court cases as best you can Murdoch versus Pennsylvania is a unique
(1:04:03) case it's recorded at 319 U.S 105. that's the 319th volume of United States
(1:04:10) Supreme Court reports on page 105. so when you go to the law library go into
(1:04:16) U.S reports ask a little Gallery the little guy that's behind the counter where is the United States Supreme Court
(1:04:22) reports they'll tell you right where it is you grab volume 319 you turn to page 105 and it'll give you the case in
(1:04:28) Murdoch versus Pennsylvania Murdock versus Pennsylvania is a real unique case
(1:04:33) and I'm I'm telling you to read the case
(1:04:38) the case the judge always likes to see that you're ready and I'm going to submit basically the
(1:04:44) case briefly basically it is a religious test case wherein Jehovah's Witness in
(1:04:50) the in the year of 1943 wanted their right to be able to go and preach among
(1:04:55) the public because that is their right to evangelize okay Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania
(1:05:02) they wanted them to have a license to solicit okay this is basically the
(1:05:07) crooks of the case now what happened was uh this the Jehovah's Witness claimed their First
(1:05:13) Amendment right of life liberty and pursuit of happiness the right to worship and and exercise their religion
(1:05:20) unencumbered right and of course that's one of the main states that founded this country was the
(1:05:26) religious freedom okay and basically the points on the case that are established are a state may not impose a charge for
(1:05:33) the enjoyment of a right granted by the Federal Constitution and that a flat license tax here
(1:05:38) involved restrains in advance the Constitutional Liberties of press and religion and inevitably tends to
(1:05:43) suppress their existence right let's pull that over there everybody see that
(1:05:49) okay all right I'll start again a state may not impose a charge for the enjoyment of
(1:05:56) a right granted by the Federal Constitution and that a flat license tax here involved restrains in advance the
(1:06:04) Constitutional Liberties of the press and religion and inevitably tends to suppress the exercise thereof that the
(1:06:10) ordinance is non-discriminatory and that it applies also to Peddlers of Wares and merchandises and material the Liberties
(1:06:17) granted by the First Amendment are and in a preferred position since the privilege in question is guaranteed by
(1:06:23) the Federal Constitution and exists independently of the state's Authority the inquiry as to whether the state has
(1:06:29) given something for which it cannot ask a return is irrelevant
(1:06:35) all right no state may convert a secured Liberty into a privilege and issue a
(1:06:40) license and a fee for it now a lot of people come back to me and say well I'm not a Jehovah's Witness so that case doesn't apply to me I want you to reach
(1:06:48) I want you to understand we're not talking about whether you're a Jehovah's Witness here what we're talking about here is are you an American and do you
(1:06:55) have rights what they are talking about here is that these Jehovah's Witness people exercise
(1:07:00) their rights timely that they had a right to worship and exercise and and worship their God and evangelize as they
(1:07:07) chose and that the state came in and arbitrarily converted that right into a privilege and issued a license and a fee for it that is totally unconstitutional
(1:07:15) now we took that case as a pioneering case and we argue that case for all of your
(1:07:20) constitutional rights all you need to do is keep in mind that you are an American and you have
(1:07:26) constitutional rights number one number two you have to keep in mind what right can you pull the right out of the
(1:07:31) Constitution if you can pull the right out of the Constitution and I'll give you an example how about the right to travel
(1:07:36) freely and encumbent pursuant to share versus Thompson and we'll get into that how about the right to keep in bear arms
(1:07:42) right does the state have a right to require a license and a fee for the exercise of the right and if they do can
(1:07:47) you ignore the license in a fee we'll get into that now obviously in this case
(1:07:53) it's clearly established and this is the premise of this case no state may convert a secured Liberty
(1:08:01) into a privilege issue a license and a fee for it and require you to have that
(1:08:08) otherwise you committed a crime that's totally 100 percent unconstitutional I want that to get across real clear now
(1:08:15) let's jump to the next Case by the way Murdoch is recorded at 319 that's the
(1:08:21) 319 volume U.S reports page 105 will start the case
(1:08:26) all right go read the case though make sure you read the case I don't want anybody to come up and tell me they
(1:08:31) didn't read the case because I'm gonna get on you you're not filing that's failure to follow instructions
(1:08:37) okay now we're gonna walk down the next step of this case we we took care of
(1:08:42) Murdoch here let's go to Shuttlesworth versus Birmingham Alabama which is recorded at volume 373. the same U.S
(1:08:50) reports you go to volume 373 turn to page 262. when we go to Shuttlesworth
(1:08:56) versus Birmingham Alabama this is another unique religious case
(1:09:01) okay in this case six ministers were accused
(1:09:06) of inciting to Riot and otherwise create a disturbance and disturb the peace okay
(1:09:12) they had a sit down this case came down in 1962.
(1:09:17) and what happened was they said they needed to have a license to to have a public uh
(1:09:24) Gathering okay and what happened was it went to the Supreme Court Supreme Court says no no
(1:09:31) no you don't need to have a license for the exercise of a First Amendment right to freely Assemble
(1:09:36) okay right basically the gist of the case is uh
(1:09:42) the Negro ministers were convicted in Alabama State Court of aiding and abetting and violation of Criminal Trespass ordinance in Birmingham Alabama
(1:09:48) the only evidence against them was to the effect that they had incited 10 negro students to engage in a sit-down
(1:09:54) demonstration in a white Lunch Counter actually there were six ministers but only two got charged as a protest
(1:10:00) against the racial segregation and they cite other cases a lot of times you can find other cases in these cases
(1:10:06) and Goldberg versus city of Birmingham Alabama this court today holds on the authority of Peterson versus City of
(1:10:12) Greenville that the convictions of those 10 students for Criminal Trespass were constitutionally invalid since those
(1:10:18) convictions have been set aside it follows that these petitioners did not incite or Aid and abet any crime and
(1:10:25) that therefore the convictions of these petitioners must be set aside now basically what they were claiming is
(1:10:31) their constitutional right to freely unassemble the cities was claiming that they had to have a license to put on a
(1:10:36) demonstration which they didn't have and they were charging them with a Criminal Trespass for not having a valid license
(1:10:43) to freely assemble and or uh protest okay now the gist of this case
(1:10:51) I want you to see the significance of this case in view of the second the case we gave you before that Murdoch versus
(1:10:57) Pennsylvania clearly established that no state could convert a secured Liberty and a privileged initial license and a fee for it because everybody got that
(1:11:03) Shuttlesworth versus Birmingham Alabama said that if the state does convert your right into a privilege and issue a
(1:11:09) license and a fee for it you can ignore the license and if you engage in the right with impunity that means they can't punish you they gotta let you go
(1:11:15) all right does everybody see that it's very important that you understand first your Constitution is the supreme law of
(1:11:20) land that means you have that right and that that right shall not be in French and it's supposed to be enforced in favor of you the query intended and
(1:11:27) expressly designated beneficiary it's very important that you understand that no state may convert that right into a privilege an issue a license and a fee
(1:11:33) for it and if they do Shuttlesworth versus Birmingham Alabama says you can ignore the license and engage in an array with impunity that means they
(1:11:39) can't punish you now the next case is very important and it's very important that you see the
(1:11:44) argument okay that's United States versus Bishop that's 412 I am 412 United States
(1:11:51) reports so the page 346. we come down here
(1:11:58) United States versus Bishop is a very unique case [Applause] basically what Bishop does is it sets a
(1:12:06) standard for what constitutes a criminal violation in terms of willful intent
(1:12:11) okay willfulness is is one of the major elements that is required to be proven
(1:12:18) in any criminal element you have to prove one that you're the party two that you had a method or an opportunity to do
(1:12:24) the thing and third that you did so with a willful intent now when we get to willful intent willful is defined as an
(1:12:30) evil motive or intent to avoid an own due to your task under the law with a moral certainty obviously in the
(1:12:36) previous two cases you have decided that you have relied on the United States Constitution
(1:12:42) and you have relied on decisions of the United States Supreme Court
(1:12:47) so could you have willfully done any deed or crime obviously not so guess
(1:12:53) what this case stipulates that you have a perfect defense to the element of willfulness all right since the burden
(1:12:59) on the prosecution is to prove that you did willfully annoyingly avoid a known Duty or task under the law a moral certainty he cannot perform that task
(1:13:06) any because it's obviously you have your constitutional immunity to that the previous case shuttles workers
(1:13:11) Birmingham Alabama so they couldn't even punish it the case before that said you didn't need a license for the exercise of a
(1:13:17) right and the case before that said your constitutional right is supreme over any state law so if they pass the law in violation of your Constitution the
(1:13:24) Constitution overwhelms the state law so the law doesn't even exist a lot does everybody see that now since the
(1:13:29) prosecutor does not have a cause of action for which only can be granted your enemy and please the court council is specifically precluded from
(1:13:36) performing his major task Therefore your honor may please record at this time I would motion most graciously for a
(1:13:41) dismissal with prejudice for failure to State a cause of action for which release may be granted by this honorable court and I'd kind of like to collect my
(1:13:48) costs and fees for having to defend this patently frivolous inspiration complaint sir may you please the court
(1:13:53) laughter will usually break out thereafter at which point the judge will usually turn to the prosecutor and say
(1:13:59) Well Mr pearls what do you think we ought to do about this young fella and he'll say I'd go for the motion to
(1:14:04) dismiss your honor and the judge will turn to him and say that's a good answer because I don't think you're ready for this kid today
(1:14:10) and 40 attorneys will break out laughing okay that's actually happened to me
(1:14:16) folks I'm telling you this argument is a killer argument it's good for every
(1:14:21) single constitutional right you've got all you have to do is fill in the blanks what constitutional right prove that you
(1:14:28) have the constitutional right tell them the state doesn't have a right to convert that right into a privilege tell them that they can't even punish you if
(1:14:34) they do and then claim that the prosecutor can't improve willfulness so you obviously didn't do no crime and
(1:14:39) then flip around and demand for your dismissal which is your right and get your costs and fees for having to defend this frivolous case may I please the
(1:14:45) court and I promise you you will be amazed 40 attorneys will jump up and say yeah
(1:14:52) they'll come up and shake your hand and tell you that's one of the most magnificent arguments they've ever heard they'll tell you you got something like
(1:14:57) King Kong for taking on the bar association or whatever now I'm telling you these things that
(1:15:04) personally happen to me I can relate the exact cases that goes for practicing law without a license obviously you got it
(1:15:10) right to work you got to write the contract you're you're right to work as you see fit notice some arbitrary
(1:15:16) Caprice Inspire Association sees fit right does that make sense to you you don't want to belong to the union that's
(1:15:21) your right this is this is a right to work state right the bottom line is this they cannot
(1:15:28) compel you to have a license or pay a fee for the exercise of your right and if they do you can ignore the
(1:15:34) license and if you engage in the right with impunity that means they can't punish him since you got a perfect defense to the element of willfulness
(1:15:39) they cannot punish you they have to dismiss they do not have a cause of action now this argument I'm
(1:15:47) telling you is taking us over 18 years to develop in the courts and in law
(1:15:52) libraries over the years and just kind of compiling and arguing cases and doing this this argument is a killer argument
(1:15:58) there have yet have they ever won against us on this argument uh nor could
(1:16:04) they in the United States of America as long as the Constitution stands I'm asking if you pay attention to this
(1:16:10) argument and start utilizing it we'll show you some of the techniques later in the second half all right now the word
(1:16:15) willfully has the same meaning all right in controlling the voluntary intentional
(1:16:21) violation of a known legal Duty and the distinction between the statute is found in the additional misconduct
(1:16:28) that is essential to the violation of the felony provision if they can't prove willfulness they can't prove NADA okay
(1:16:35) because everybody got that now let's go to the next one
(1:16:41) now that you've won and your rights have been violated the next thing they will claim while we
(1:16:47) acting in good faith for what we act in good faith we had good faith Reliance that you broke the law
(1:16:54) okay and that means you can't sue us
(1:16:59) that's a lie you see since these two cases Owen versus City of Independence which is
(1:17:06) recorded at 100 volume and you want to look at Supreme Court reports now that's
(1:17:11) a different reporter Supreme Court reports will actually say on the back of the reporters Supreme Court reports it won't say U.S it'll say
(1:17:18) Supreme Court reports so so that's a different volume it's a newer a newer reporter so you want the 100th volume
(1:17:24) and you want to look up Supreme Court reports and you want to turn to page 1398. there is a a also a counterpart
(1:17:32) case to this own case which is remember which is uh main versus Thibodeau
(1:17:38) I'll give you the site for those okay I gave you Owen receive any
(1:17:44) pennants so I'll give you main versus Thibodeau main versus Thibodeaux is recorded at 100 Supreme Court that's
(1:17:51) 100th volume Supreme Court reports page 2502
(1:17:57) now basically the summation of what these what what these basic arguments say where plain language of a statute
(1:18:04) supported by consistent judicial interpretation is strong it is not necessary to look beyond the words of
(1:18:10) the statute right now what these are both civil rights cases
(1:18:15) the right of action created by Statute relating to deprivation under color of law of state law of a right secured by
(1:18:22) the Constitution and the laws of the United States encompasses claims which are based solely on statutory violations of federal law and apply to the claim
(1:18:29) that claimants had been deprived of their rights in some capacity to which they were entitled now whenever this
(1:18:36) happens folks you must understand something and that goes for both Maine versus libido and Owen versus
(1:18:42) Independence and I'll tell you the brief synopsis on both these cases Owen was a
(1:18:48) police chief in a town of Independence Missouri and he got in a gripe with the
(1:18:53) city council indiscriminately fired and without just cause no one turned around in sued
(1:19:00) they claim that they acted in good faith the Supreme Court said sir you are
(1:19:07) deemed to be officers of the law you are to advise us to the law you can hardly claim that you act in good faith for a
(1:19:12) willful deprivation of the law and you certainly can't claim ignorance of the law because of Citizen out here in a street can't claim ignorance of the loan
(1:19:18) it makes the law look stupid if an officer of the quarters some officer of government doesn't know the law and then
(1:19:24) they go ahead and abuse somebody's constitutional right so in manners of constitutional rights both these cases
(1:19:29) uphold one point and the point they uphold is that whenever they violate your constitutional rights they do so at
(1:19:34) their own Peril and it even says that entitled 18 United States code section 241 and 242 it says that upon conviction
(1:19:41) you are subject to a ten thousand dollar fine ten years in jail or both and if death results life in prison they're
(1:19:46) telling you don't violate somebody's rights please I'll do that title 42 United States code sections 1983 1985
(1:19:53) and 1986 query established your right to sue anybody that does that now they're going to claim you can't sue
(1:19:59) them because they have judicial immunity well guess what these two cases remove judicial immunity there is no judicial
(1:20:06) immunity for violating somebody's constitutional rights judge you are deemed to know the law and sworn to uphold it you can hardly claim that you
(1:20:12) act in good faith for willful deprivation of the law and you certainly can't plead ignorance of the law for that and make the law look stupid for a
(1:20:18) knowledgeable judge to claim ignorance of the law when a citizen on a street can't claim ignorance of the law therefore there is no judicial immunity
(1:20:25) I want to get that across I don't know how many attorneys come up to me all the time tell me well they're immune because they acted in good faith they're
(1:20:32) just not reading their Court they're not reading their Court reports because if they had read in their Court reports they would have known this case has been
(1:20:37) on the book since 1982. both both these cases came down in 1982. so I want you
(1:20:44) to pay attention to these cases when somebody tells you they can violate your rights with with impunity you just kind
(1:20:49) of smile and say make my day okay
(1:20:55) now the next case we want to talk about is Briars versus United States
(1:21:01) mentioned it previously earlier Breyers was recorded at 273 volume 273
(1:21:07) U.S reports page 28 okay now rarest races United States is in a
(1:21:13) unique case it's a search and seizure case but basically it sets constitutional standards which we had
(1:21:18) talked about in the amgurus Prudence sections in the amgurus Prudence sections okay I
(1:21:26) especially want to pay attention to note number three here constitutional Provisions for the
(1:21:31) security of a person in property are to be liberally construed and it is the duty of the courts To Be watchful for
(1:21:37) the constitutional rights of the citizen and against any stealthy encroachment they're in all right when a Federal
(1:21:43) Officer participates officially with the state official in a search so that in substance and effect it is their joint
(1:21:50) operation the legality of the search and the use and evidence of the things seized is to be tested in federal
(1:21:56) prosecutions as it would be if the undertaking were exclusively the federal
(1:22:02) agent all right the reality here is what they are
(1:22:08) setting is the standards must be liberally construed in favor of the citizen it's the duty of the court to
(1:22:13) make sure that happens so now you have a right to be wrong you have a
(1:22:18) right to uh enter your viable defenses that you honestly think no State can
(1:22:23) convert that right in their privilege initial license and a fee if they do you can ignore the license in the fee they
(1:22:28) have must per they must prove the burden of proof of willfulness which they cannot do if they do violate your rights you do
(1:22:35) have a right to sue them and Owens versus City of Independence Maine versus libido they have to give every consideration to you all right and
(1:22:43) that's the way it is 1900 yesterday all right the next case we want to talk about is boy Boyd versus United States
(1:22:50) 116 U.S page 616. the court is to protect against encroachment of
(1:22:56) constitutionality or secure Liberty all right now it is equivalent to a compulsory
(1:23:02) production of papers to make the non-production of them a confession of the allegations which is is pretended
(1:23:10) they will prove and a lot of times that happens in federal cases they'll claim something they won't prove it this
(1:23:16) happened to me believe me and then the fact that they've claimed it makes it true
(1:23:21) and then of course you have to prove a negative which is impossible all right now the seizure compulsory
(1:23:28) production of a man's private papers to be used in evidence against him is equivalent to compelling him to be a
(1:23:34) witness against himself in violation of Fifth Amendment and in a prosecution for a crime penalty or forfeiture is equally
(1:23:41) within the prohibition of the Fifth Amendment see that now the bottom line here is
(1:23:47) [Applause] Lloyd protects against encroachment of constitutionally secured Liberties let's
(1:23:54) arguing the Fifth Amendment here but it's basically arguing against encroachment right so that's when you want to pay attention to when you're
(1:23:59) coming especially to things on search and seizure Natures another good case that you should know is your Miranda
(1:24:05) versus Arizona and folks I'm going to tell you something and even I can learn something not that
(1:24:10) I'm not much above you I want to come to you humbly in humility I'm I'm telling
(1:24:15) you I've read and I know and there's a lot of things about the law and I've been my own attorney for over 25 years and I kicked the tail out I'll be honest
(1:24:22) with you but I always can learn something and I'm not stupid enough ever not to realize that the next thing I'm going to tell you is probably one of the
(1:24:28) most important things we're going to tell you today this is the Miranda versus Arizona decision
(1:24:33) it's recorded at 384 volume 384 us that's U.S reports page 436. now this is
(1:24:40) a heavy duty case every American should know this case backward and forward upside down another
(1:24:46) all right Miranda versus Arizona
(1:24:51) this is the one that says you got to raise your main sound you got to write to an attorney you gotta rate to have your turning president requesting anything you say you can will be held
(1:24:58) against you in a court of law if you can't afford an attorney you want to be appointed for you by the court you wish to make any statement on your behalf and
(1:25:03) you understand the rights that I have spoken to you as soon as they stop you talk to you as
(1:25:09) soon as they start talking to you they are required to say that if they don't say that they screwed up
(1:25:15) if they haul you into jail and they don't tell you this read it to you and then they want to make you sign a little
(1:25:22) uh statement and you know your rights and you knowingly wave them please folks don't sign that statement
(1:25:28) use your head for some mother in a hat rack you're not signing that statement ever
(1:25:33) you're annoyingly waving your constitutional rights don't ever do that
(1:25:40) I mean it'll make they don't make it that hard
(1:25:45) as soon as you hear those people start talking it you tell them right effectively I want to talk to an attorney and I'm not saying nothing
(1:25:52) until I talk to an attorney especially if you're a tarponent of federal people batf these people will lie cheat steal they
(1:25:59) will do anything they can to hammer you their whole purpose in life is to hammer you I don't want you
(1:26:06) to think well what nice guys so maybe we can just work this out why don't we just talk or maybe we can get things worked out you don't talk to these people folks
(1:26:12) and you're talking to somebody you learn the hard way you do not talk to these people ever I
(1:26:18) don't care if you think you're a nice guy and you want to be courteous I don't think you think if you're going to work it out I don't think you think if you're
(1:26:24) gonna you're smarter in the air and you can beat him I'm telling you you don't talk to them period you button that
(1:26:29) hatch an old wiser legal defense counsel told me one time he said the first rule is
(1:26:35) keep your big mouth shut I said okay what's the second row keep your big mouth shut
(1:26:41) he said what's the third rule keep your big mouth shut is it after you file them three rules the rest is easy
(1:26:47) it's when you open your big mouth that you get in trouble not that you would do anything wrong anyway but they'll twist lie cheat and
(1:26:53) steal and make it into something you didn't do and before you know it you won't even recognize what's happened I'm telling you it's happened to me
(1:27:00) so I'm telling you as a friend I'm not telling you as a smart ass or anything else I'm telling you as a friend do not talk to these people they they do not
(1:27:07) have your best interest and hurt and you may think well they're the government and then they're responsible and they
(1:27:13) mean well well they don't they don't mean well they don't mean here well and they will Jam you believe me
(1:27:20) and if you're not real good at getting out of it you can you can be in a lot of trouble all right now
(1:27:26) let's look at this Miranda decision in the absence of other effective measures the following procedures to safeguard
(1:27:32) the fifth member privileges must be observed the person in custody must prior to interrogation be clearly
(1:27:38) informed that he has a right to remain silent and then anything he says will be used against him in a court of law
(1:27:44) he must be clearly informed that he has a right to consult with a lawyer and he
(1:27:49) to have a lawyer with him during interrogation do that please and that if he is in the general lawyer
(1:27:55) will be appointed to represent him all right if the individual indicates prior to endearing questioning that he wishes
(1:28:02) to remain silent the interrogation must cease if he states that he wants an attorney
(1:28:08) the questioning must cease until an attorney is present where an
(1:28:13) interrogation is conducted without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken a heavy burden rests on the
(1:28:18) government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his constitutional Council right
(1:28:24) don't test that theory but I'm telling you it works I did it
(1:28:30) what are the individual answers some questions during interrogation or custody interrogation he has not waived
(1:28:35) his privilege it may invoke his right to remain silent thereafter the warnings require that the waiver needed are in
(1:28:42) the absence of a fully effective equivalent prerequisite to the admission or admissibility of any statement
(1:28:48) inculpability or exculpability made by the defendant the limitations on the interrogation process required for the
(1:28:54) protection of the individual's constitutional rights should not cause and undue interference with the proper
(1:29:00) system of law enforcement as demonstrated by the procedures of the FBI and the safeguards afforded to other
(1:29:06) jurisdiction in each of these cases the statements were obtained under circumstances that did not meet constitutional standards for
(1:29:13) protection of the privilege against self-incrimination now this is the big one folks this is the one they're
(1:29:18) talking about did you properly mirandize him was he mirandized was she demandize
(1:29:24) Athena mirandize you they got to throw the case out almost always
(1:29:29) it's very hard to go forward with the case if they're Witnesses are
(1:29:36) excludable from the presentation of the case now I personally got lucky on this one
(1:29:42) folks and I thought I was really really good and I am really really good
(1:29:48) but you want to know something I have a different standard of equity and lot and
(1:29:55) I treat everybody kindly and I basically give them courtesy and I basically try
(1:30:00) and be a regular Joe and I basically uh try to uh
(1:30:07) basically just find out what the heck was going on with this case I promise you I would never do that
(1:30:12) again I would dummy up like there's no tomorrow I wouldn't say nothing not that I'd do anything wrong but here's the thing
(1:30:17) these people lied so bad they put so much trash in in the record I was in
(1:30:23) shock I couldn't believe that anybody would deliberately do such a thing
(1:30:29) but they will so I'm telling you as a friend do not talk to these people especially batf
(1:30:36) people they are not honorable people they don't hold they do not recognize the honor you serve
(1:30:43) they are not honorable people their whole purpose is to hammer you into a position of Ridiculousness
(1:30:49) so I'm telling you if they come in to talk to you for whatever reason I don't care what you dummy up you don't say
(1:30:55) nothing you got me you hire an attorney you get an attorney there and you don't talk to me attorney
(1:31:00) tells you to that's what I'm telling you as a friend okay that's Miranda versus Arizona now
(1:31:07) there's four Miranda cases this is the leading case there is a Miranda warning case that actually locks down the steps
(1:31:15) of the warning and then there's a Miranda interrogation case which which locks out the standards for uh in
(1:31:23) custody jail interrogations okay now
(1:31:28) a word to the Y should be sufficient and I shouldn't have to ever say nothing about that again believe me I learned a
(1:31:33) valuable lesson you cannot assume that everybody is a
(1:31:39) good guy there are some bad ones out there and I found them now the next case we're going to talk
(1:31:44) about is Norton versus Shelby County recorded at 118 volume United States reports page 425 basically
(1:31:53) that says an unconstitutional Act is not law it confers no rights it imposes no duties affords no protections it creates
(1:31:59) no office it is in legal contemplation as an inoperative as though it had never
(1:32:05) been passed okay and that's what this this case holds all right now I'm telling you you go read the case
(1:32:13) let's go around the judge asks you questions about the case you better know about what it says right
(1:32:18) because if he thinks she didn't read it he's going to throw your case out the court follows the decision of the
(1:32:24) highest court of the state in construing the Constitution and the laws of the state unless they conflict with or
(1:32:30) impair the F efficacy of some principle of the Federal Constitution or of the federal statutes or a rule of the
(1:32:36) commercial or general law the decision of the state courts on questions relating to the existence of its
(1:32:42) subordinate tribunals and the eligibility and election or appointment of their officers and the passage of its
(1:32:48) laws are conclusive upon federal courts all right now the most important some of the most
(1:32:55) important thing is while acts of de facto incumbent of an office lawfully created by law and existing are often
(1:33:01) held to be binding from reasons of public policy that's a very important Point Public Policy you want to watch
(1:33:07) out for the terms public policy it's often confused with the state's right of
(1:33:12) imminent domain of police Powers police powers and public policy are almost the same thing set ones done without law
(1:33:18) because we wants to and the other is done because they're claiming a police authority to do so all right
(1:33:24) but when they're talking about public policy the acts of the person assuming to fill and perform the duties of an
(1:33:30) office which does not exist can have no validity whatever in law
(1:33:37) okay an unconstitutional Act is not a law it confers no rights it imposes no duties
(1:33:42) it affords no protection it creates no office it is in legal contemplation as inoperative as though it had never been
(1:33:49) passed okay has everybody got that now this basic first portion of this
(1:33:54) program is designed clearly to help you
(1:34:00) and if you take these basic cases on this one page you will have gone a long way in getting your constitutional
(1:34:06) rights back okay now we're asking you
(1:34:12) pay attention learn your Constitution we're going to go into some heavier stuff through the
(1:34:18) second portion of it but we want you to learn your Constitution this book here is a Citizens rule book it also has jury
(1:34:26) instructions in it and also has a lot of important arguments in it some of the important arguments in it go along with
(1:34:31) what we've been talking about right all laws for Cherry pregnant Constitution are null and void Marbury versus Madison
(1:34:37) 5 yes 137 I already argue that when we're right secured by the Constitution our involved there can be no ruler
(1:34:43) lawmaking or legislation which would abrogate or abolish them that's again Miranda versus Arizona an unconstitutional Act is not law it
(1:34:50) confers no rights and imposes no duties affords no protection it creates no office all right that's Norton versus
(1:34:55) Shelby County which we just talked about the general rule is an unconstitutional statute of having the form of name of
(1:35:01) laws in reality no law but it's holy void all right 16th amateur is prude and second section 177 and also 256.
(1:35:08) officers of the Court have no immunity when violating constitutional right from liability that's on the first city of
(1:35:14) Independence Maine versus Thibodaux no State shall converge secured Liberties and their Privileges and issue licenses and fees for Marinette versus
(1:35:20) Pennsylvania if the state does convert Liberty or privilege into a privileged citizen can
(1:35:26) engage in Arabic impunity that shuttles rivers of Birmingham Alabama the court is to protect against any encroachment
(1:35:31) of constitutionally secured Liberties that's Boyd versus United States constitutional rights must be interpreted in favor of the citizen
(1:35:37) that's barriers versus United States we have covered all of these cases thoroughly so that you can see clearly
(1:35:43) all right we're trying to teach you how to better effectively use your Constitution okay
(1:35:51) we're trying to get it down to a serious program and this this book here also
(1:35:57) brings out all these court cases right notice it's got Norton versus Shelby County in here it's gotten random versus
(1:36:02) Arizona it's got Madison fire Marbury versus Madison it's got uh
(1:36:08) the jury has a right to judge both the law as well as the fact John Jay first Chief Justice U.S Supreme Court the jury
(1:36:14) has a right to determine both the law and effect Samuel Chase U.S Supreme Court Justice 1796 singer you know all
(1:36:21) right the jury has the power to bring a verdict in the teeth of both law in fact Oliver Wendell Holmes U.S Supreme Court
(1:36:26) the law itself is on trial quite as much as the cause which is to be decided
(1:36:32) Harlan F Stone 12th chief justice U.S Supreme Court the pages of History shine on instances of the jury's exercise of
(1:36:39) its prerogative to disregard instructions of the judge that's the United States versus Doherty 473 fed
(1:36:45) second 113. all right now
(1:36:50) we're going to wrap up this first part here basically we want we want you folks to
(1:36:56) hopefully not be overwhelmed take your time play the tape several times it'll
(1:37:01) it'll come to you it's really not that hard we want you to have a new reverence for your Constitution
(1:37:07) we want you to know that a lot of brave Soldiers paid for it with their life we want you to know that they died miserably some of them
(1:37:14) and we want you to know that this is a serious very serious thing here we want you to know that we love you America and
(1:37:20) we want you to know we need your help to learn your Constitution so you can
(1:37:25) better and effectively come forward pick that book up walk out there and shake that book and say shaken
(1:37:31) in Boss all right now that we've gone over the Constitution and we've talked about some
(1:37:37) of the ways that you can use it now we're going to go into some of the ways that you can apply it okay the things to
(1:37:43) do first of all is when you pull over try not to demonstrate any rapid
(1:37:48) movements or any uh like you're reaching under the seat or you're reaching in the glove box keep
(1:37:55) your hands where you can be seen do not overreact try and be calm talk to the
(1:38:00) officer in a mellow voice don't yell or holler use profanity whatsoever
(1:38:06) basically it's yes sir you know what can I do for you sir they'll usually ask you to produce your
(1:38:12) documentation you have license proof of insurance and the registration of the vehicle okay
(1:38:18) issues on those programming to cover that to show you some of the things that you can do and what you can have to do
(1:38:26) also I recommend that you treat the officer as I told the other gentleman there very courteously because uh
(1:38:32) that is going to get you a lot farther ahead and giving them a lot of negative hype or trying to shout out shout them
(1:38:38) or give them a lot of static so my honest counsel is let me show you how we
(1:38:45) proceed most of the time you will be able to leave the scene without any Serious
(1:38:51) injury you might have a ticket or this or that but we'll show you how to deal with that okay but you need to be understanding that uh
(1:38:57) this party is an armed party and you don't want to do any movements that's going to cause him to overreact to a
(1:39:04) injury of you yeah and you'll find it this is the most dangerous thing a
(1:39:09) police officer does to stop people all day because he never knows when somebody might do some really serious traumatic
(1:39:14) thing you know so they're very nervous about this and the quicker you can relieve their nervousness and just be a
(1:39:22) regular person let them realize you're just gonna talk any plain and common voice the sooner you're going to be in a
(1:39:31) communicative situation now obviously you're going to find out real quick if you've got a Cooperative officer or not if you don't have a Cooperative officer
(1:39:37) five then you're going to be in court anyway so the best thing I can tell you is be patient just let us follow along with
(1:39:44) our program and we'll be happy to demonstrate again we would like to let you know that your best defenses are in your Constitution that that Constitution
(1:39:51) is a viable contract that it is enforceable in the court of law under the statute of fraud says you have a right to claim those rights that the
(1:39:58) burden is on you to claim them timely and a key word here is timely or you lose the rate so you want to be uh
(1:40:04) cognizant of your rights and be able to timely speak up okay now let's go on to a couple of things here
(1:40:10) we're going to we're going to concentrate as we did before on our main basic cases we also
(1:40:17) want to give you some further Advanced programming the book The Federalist Papers by
(1:40:23) Madison Hamilton and Jade those are the gentlemen that wrote the United States Constitution okay
(1:40:28) and you want the mentor Edition because it is the unabridged Edition now the Supreme Court has ruled in the
(1:40:34) case of Cohen versus Virginia that's recorded at six lead reporter volume
(1:40:39) volume 6 page two all right now wheat is an old report and this was done in 1821
(1:40:46) so you may have to go to your leading Law Library around like we go to Michigan University of Michigan or we go
(1:40:51) to Detroit college of law but you want a very these pages will be so old you'll have to worry how you turn
(1:40:57) them without trying to screw them up but the Supreme Court ruled in the manner of Cohen versus Virginia six week
(1:41:05) two that this book The Federalist Papers was the exact record of the intent of
(1:41:11) the framers of the Constitution Madison Hamilton and Jay those are the guys that wrote the Constitution so obviously
(1:41:17) being able to to read their published thoughts as they were doing this
(1:41:22) constitution is very very forceful in terms of constitutional interpretation in the
(1:41:29) intent of the lawmaker is the law and it shall be liberally enforced in favor of you you are a clearly intended and
(1:41:34) expressly designated beneficiary got me so every food to enhance your position
(1:41:42) in terms of how your lawmakers thought when they framed this constitution
(1:41:47) clearly makes your case even more stronger for the Constitution be interpreted in Fay review so we
(1:41:53) recommend you get a copy of this Federalist Papers you read it cover to cover you want the mentor Edition because that's the unabridged Edition
(1:41:59) you'll find some of the other editions got some of the pages pulled out okay now we want to get into some of the
(1:42:05) cases basically the second program that we have here is the advanced section we
(1:42:10) are going to be covering procedures we're going to be teaching you how to be your own Council we're going to be telling you some facts and issues on
(1:42:16) what to do what happens when you get pulled over how do you exercise your rights in a timely fashion we're going to be talking
(1:42:23) about some of the the problems that are going on in America today we're going to be
(1:42:28) talking about some of the studies that have been done we just had a law review study put out
(1:42:34) by this uh this lady here [Applause] her name is uh
(1:42:41) Joyce Lee Malcolm Joyce Lee Malcolm she started out working for the uh
(1:42:48) the anti-gun people she is a Harvard uh
(1:42:53) a Harvard uh legal scholar she is very very knowledgeable she researched the right
(1:43:01) to keep in Mirror arms of the people back to the 1700s in England
(1:43:06) and she came to the honest belief after all of her research and of course she would be following her research because
(1:43:11) she is a person of very Acclaim in terms of her study she researched it back to the 1700s and
(1:43:18) found houses yep our right to keep in bear arms is a positive right it has come from serious law all the way back
(1:43:24) to the Magna Carta and uh
(1:43:30) she published a book and the book here is to keep in their arms it's a rather
(1:43:37) extensive book okay uh you might it's not hard to get a hold
(1:43:43) of it did take us about 10 days of ordering it to get a hold of it uh but it's a definitive study and the
(1:43:50) right to keep in bear arms that verifies the the Holdings that your average person uh whose NRA oriented or who
(1:43:58) basically is constitutionally oriented is going to be happy to have which is basically the right to keep mirror arms
(1:44:03) is a protected right that goes back with great legal scholarly study okay
(1:44:10) so these are a couple things that you can use to help you defend okay
(1:44:15) we need to understand that at the beginning of every one of these laws there is an enabling Clause that
(1:44:22) basically says how the law shall be brought into being and there is an argument that the law
(1:44:29) that is presently here today is based on some law on the past okay
(1:44:34) and almost on every one of these constitutions all the way up through our history through the Articles of Confederation through the U.S
(1:44:40) Constitution through uh various state constitutions they'll have an enabling law in the beginning and of course the
(1:44:46) the enabling law just allows them to bring their version of The Constitution of what rights are there today that the
(1:44:53) rights that were had before or carried on plus are further delineated by this
(1:44:58) constitution but at no time do they have a right to abridge the previous document now going all the way back to the Magna
(1:45:06) Carta you can see the decisions where it comes down the Magna Carta the Declaration of Independence the Articles of Confederation the United States
(1:45:12) Constitution the Virginia acts of concession the Northwest Ordinance the Northwest Territorial government the
(1:45:18) Northwest Territorial division Indiana the Indiana Michigan territorial division the enabling acts and that's
(1:45:24) what I'm I'm trying to explain to you today the Michigan organization in in submitting Alternatives and the Michigan
(1:45:30) assent to a condition of admission and then the state of Michigan became a state in 1837. now this is just from my
(1:45:38) area so I'm trying to give you an example there is then we have a constitution of 1835. we have a
(1:45:43) constitution of 1850. we have a constitution of 1908 we have a constitution of 1963. every time one of
(1:45:50) these constitutions comes by the enabling acts in the beginning of it state that everything that was before
(1:45:56) guaranteed is brought forward okay
(1:46:01) so everything that is before his brother
(1:46:07) is stronger okay it's never made weaker it's made stronger or it's equal to so all of the rights brought forward are
(1:46:13) carried all the way back from the Magna Carta as a line of succession so this is how you historically review
(1:46:20) Trends and where what and how it comes from and how uh authorities are established in law okay to our normal
(1:46:28) procedure here we have our court cases here we're going to start giving you examples of court cases as we go and
(1:46:34) we're going to show you how you can exercise rates one of the first cases that we are going to bring
(1:46:40) is basically the right to travel all right now there's a lot of people that are interested in this particular issue
(1:46:46) and license plates and driver's licenses and all this and you have a lot of programming that's uh
(1:46:52) that's uh problematic from this and you have a lot of people that are looking to
(1:46:57) argue so we want to share some basic arguments with you we're going to claim a First
(1:47:04) Amendment right to travel and we're going to claim also a fifth amendment it's guaranteed under the Fifth
(1:47:09) Amendment of due process and equal protection under the law all right now
(1:47:15) we come down we looked up in our state constitution
(1:47:20) and this is uh our constitution and basically we have protected a right
(1:47:27) to travel okay the freedom to travel is a fundamental
(1:47:33) right that should be unlimited by statutes rules or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict movement
(1:47:40) okay now then a law which substantially affects or penalizes the exercise of the
(1:47:47) right to travel may be justified only by a compelling State interest and must be
(1:47:52) tailored carefully to avoid unnecessary infringement on the right okay now when
(1:47:58) we come down here we start reading some of these arguments you'll notice these little letters here that say freedom to travel throughout the United States has
(1:48:05) long been recognized as a basic right under the Federal Constitution C note 54s everybody see this little note 54
(1:48:11) here again we're going to take this node 54 we're going to come down here and the very first case that we have is Shapiro
(1:48:17) versus Thompson this has recorded it at 394. that's volume 394 us page 618.
(1:48:27) and I just haven't had a copy the case here they're talking about the purpose of inhibiting Migration by
(1:48:34) needy persons into a state is constitutionally impermissible all right all citizens must be free to travel
(1:48:41) throughout the United States uninhibited by statutes rules or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this
(1:48:48) movement right if a law has no other purpose than to chill assertions of
(1:48:54) constitutional rights by penalizing those who choose to exercise them it is patently unconstitutional
(1:49:00) all right does everybody pick up on the gist of the argument here equal protection Clause prohibits
(1:49:06) apportionment of State Services according to Prior tax contributions of its citizens any classification which
(1:49:12) serves to penalize the exercise of a right of Interstate travel unless shown to be necessary to promote a compelling
(1:49:17) government interest is unconstitutional okay now that's clearly established now
(1:49:24) we go into the case and we come to find out
(1:49:29) it says that the right the right finds no explicit mention in
(1:49:35) the Constitution this is what I was trying to tell you you got to use a little bit of uh wisdom you read between
(1:49:41) the lines in other words what is your right to life liberty and pursuit of happiness what does it mean to you think about it
(1:49:48) it there you know you can look at the exact words the rate of Life they're being Pursuit of Happiness ducky what's that mean I have no idea well I'm
(1:49:55) telling you to start having an idea because when you have an idea they gotta listen
(1:50:00) so you have an idea and you say I have a right to travel freely unencumbered right now that a rate was so Elementary
(1:50:06) was conceived from the beginning to be necessary concomitant of the stronger
(1:50:11) Union the Constitution created in any event freedom to travel throughout the United States has long been recognized
(1:50:18) as a basic rate under the Constitution we've established that the right is clearly there
(1:50:24) so you were right you had a feeling that you had a right to travel and you were right there is such a right there okay
(1:50:30) one of the ways you could find arguments on that would be to go into the Federal digest at the local library go
(1:50:38) down by your Supreme Court cases there'll be a set of red books called the federal digest right next to the shepherd citations you look up the book
(1:50:45) words and phrases and in the book words and phrases you asked for the right to travel it'll give you every Supreme
(1:50:51) Court case that has anything to do with the right to travel okay one of the leading cases is this case Shapiro
(1:50:57) versus Thompson that it's such a basic rate it doesn't even need to be mentioned okay it is important that you be able to back your arguments up in
(1:51:03) other words it's one thing to pick the argument up now here we go in moving from jurisdiction to jurisdiction they
(1:51:11) were exercising their constitutional right and any classification which penalizes the exercise of the right unless shown to be necessary to promote
(1:51:17) a compelling government interest is unconstitutional right now the reality was they exercised their right to Timely
(1:51:23) Travel right and the state didn't want to allow that all right now let's flip back here first
(1:51:30) of all the Constitution is the supreme law of the land right we establish that who said so Marbury versus Madison 5V
(1:51:35) s137 1803 the constitution of these United States is a stream of land any
(1:51:40) lawn conflicts and I'll avoid a law now we know that the constitution is supreme we know that the rate is clearly established in Shapiro versus Thompson
(1:51:48) can a state arbitrarily and erroneously convert a secured Liberty in this case
(1:51:54) the right to travel freely uncovered into a privilege and issue a license and a fee for it obviously we have decided
(1:52:00) that in Murdoch versus Pennsylvania clearly no state may convert a secure Liberty into a privilege now does everybody see
(1:52:06) how we plug that in just like on your computer you you fill in the blanks okay
(1:52:11) you have the court case it says no stake and convert the liberty and your privilege initial license before what
(1:52:17) right are we talking about the rights travel freely uncommon so you plug that in so does the state have a right to require you to have a license for the
(1:52:23) exercise of their right no does everybody see that now what
(1:52:31) is Birmingham Alabama
(1:52:37) what happens if they pull you over they give you the ticket well you're going to go to court and you're going to fight it you're going to file a brief we're going to show you how to do that in a later
(1:52:43) time exactly what to put down there but these are the cases you're going to be putting
(1:52:48) down on your on your memorandum of loss to why you have a reason to feel that you're right first it's your constitutional right is superior to any
(1:52:55) law that they would put down you have that right and they can't pass a law that takes away that right secondly if
(1:53:01) they do it's unconstitutional thirdly no state may convert a secured Liberty into a privilege and issue a license and a
(1:53:06) fee for it and if they do you can ignore the license and if you engage in it right with impunity shuttles word for Birmingham Alabama and since you have
(1:53:13) not willfully done anything evil you have relied on your Constitution and on the Supreme Court decisions you have a
(1:53:18) perfect defense to the charge of willfulness so you could not have been charged with willfully not going and getting the license does everybody see
(1:53:24) that okay you have a perfect defense United States versus Bishop 412 yes 346
(1:53:32) defines willfulness as an evil mortiver intent to avoid a known due to your task under the law with a moral certainty how
(1:53:37) obviously you didn't do that did you because you have a perfect defense you relied on previous decisions of the
(1:53:42) Supreme Court Shuttlesworth and Murdoch and Marbury you relied on your constitutional right to travel freely and uncommon pursuant the Shapiro versus
(1:53:49) Thompson so you have a perfect defense so now where are we at your honor mate pleases the court I motion for dismissal
(1:53:54) with prejudice failure State and cause of action for which you leave can be granted and I would like the motion to dismiss
(1:54:00) and I like my costs and fees for having to defend this frivolous case that you have a right to collect your
(1:54:06) time for going to court all right you submit your bill you submit your proposed order you fill out your own
(1:54:12) proposed order that makes the case go faster and the judge is kind of like that and it intimidates the hell out of
(1:54:17) the prosecutor when you do your own order now let's say well that's how you
(1:54:24) interpret that sir that's right sir that is how I interpret it and 16th Amber is prudent second section 97 says that it
(1:54:33) shall be interpreted in my favor because I am the query intended and expressly designated beneficiary decision for the
(1:54:38) production rights and property see Briars versus United States 273 us 28. unlawful unless that deals with an
(1:54:44) unlawful search and seizure but it also deals that it's supposed to be interpreted in day review and Clarity intent and expressly designated
(1:54:49) beneficiary for the protection of your rights and property so they got to enforce it in favor of you right now
(1:54:55) Boyd versus United States comes next the court is to protect against any encroachment of constitutionally
(1:55:01) uh secured Liberty it's their Duty they have no choice they have to do it okay
(1:55:08) all right and Norton versus Shelby County an unconstitutional Act is not law it can Furs no rights it imposes no
(1:55:14) duties affords no protections it creates no office it is in legal contemplation
(1:55:19) as in operative though it had never been passed
(1:55:26) now after you write all of this stuff down you casually say wherefore your
(1:55:31) honor I pray before the center of a court for your just and lawful relief I
(1:55:37) ask that you dismiss this case with prejudice for failure to State a cause of action for which relate to me granted and I pray to court for my just relief
(1:55:44) for having to defend this badly frivolous and spurious case tonight my costs are whatever they are you submit
(1:55:49) that on your order I have an order I have a proposed order your honor it's in my brief
(1:55:55) at that point they will turn to the prosecutor and say Well Mr prosecutor what do you think you'd like to do about
(1:56:00) this and most of the time they're so overwhelmed at this point they just go
(1:56:05) I'll go for the dismissal unit and the judge will give him some slack well never before his young man not attorney
(1:56:11) so literally overwhelmed with accounts for the prosecution he lacens the attorneys now it's not my goal to make attorneys
(1:56:17) look bad my goal is to make you look good my goal
(1:56:22) is to make you understand your Constitution now if you happen to do it and you do it better than the attorney God bless you
(1:56:29) and God bless America and if the attorney doesn't do his homework and prepare his case I have no
(1:56:34) sympathy for him because he shouldn't have done what he was doing anyway
(1:56:40) s you to pull you aside need it done what other attorneys have done to me and said you know I hate going against the
(1:56:45) pros a litigant attorney almost always they're really really good
(1:56:51) and you know I never get to find out if they're really really good or they're really really bad until I show up and then it's too late so I'm already on the
(1:56:57) diving board and either the pool has water in it or it doesn't
(1:57:03) and usually it doesn't and it hurts when you hit the bottom so they don't like
(1:57:08) going against you people they will not like going against you if you halfway you know what the hell you're talking about they're going to be intimidated
(1:57:15) and they I I can tell you many many tales I I had this one gentleman he didn't have any plates on his car and he
(1:57:21) called him into the court and he was standing in the hallway and the prosecution said uh would you come
(1:57:27) over here sir but I'd like to talk to you he came in the office and he sat down and this party said to the prosecutor
(1:57:33) what can I do for you my prosecutor said sir okay so what can I do for you he said
(1:57:38) well it's not what you can do for me I'm the prosecutor what do you want to do in this case well I assume there was something I could do for you called me
(1:57:44) in here well what do you want to do how do you want to plead on your case well I don't
(1:57:49) intend to plead sir I intend to answer in a form with a mirror such that I do not acquiesce to quasi jurisdiction because that's an issue to be brought up
(1:57:54) my pleading some briefs to file with a court the guy's mouth was on the ground he said are you an attorney sir he says
(1:58:01) no I'm a truck driver the guy absolutely was in a panic
(1:58:08) I had the same gentleman the same gentleman later he was working as a bricklayer and he did the same thing
(1:58:14) told the prosecutor was a bricklayer and a guy's job was on the ground see they don't anticipate the people
(1:58:19) that are in other jobs other than theirs have any brains and it blows their doors off when all of
(1:58:26) a sudden this bricklayer or this truck driver can come in in argue law and all of a sudden it's
(1:58:31) like shoot this guy is good I have to treat him like he's an
(1:58:37) attorney so what did this guy do the first thing he does out of the shoot he walks up to the judge and he tells the judge he says
(1:58:42) judge I'm going to dismiss this case because he realized he was going to get hammered
(1:58:48) and the guy my guy says he can't do that I took day off work to come over here and battle
(1:58:53) I told him I said shut up sit down and relax you won I'll say nothing you won and the judge
(1:58:59) broke out laughing because this guy didn't want to quit the judge turned to me so well evidently
(1:59:04) the prosecutor doesn't want to proceed sir I'm going to have to dismiss the case he is the complaintant
(1:59:10) can he do that judge he can't do that oh I want to go let's do it
(1:59:15) and the judge laughed again he says well apparently sir I cannot sustain a complaint that is not properly before
(1:59:21) the court Council for prosecution has entered a motion to dismiss and I have no other option but to dismiss now if
(1:59:27) you want to counter sue him that's another case I'll do that
(1:59:33) in the meantime I told him will you be quiet and submit your bill submit your bill you won submit your bill for your
(1:59:40) damages so he did he's well I'll submit my bill in your honor for my costs and fees for having to defend this frivolous
(1:59:45) case and the judge smiled because people don't usually do that but if you win they are required to pay you that's the
(1:59:52) rules if you lose you pay so the bottom line is this when you file
(1:59:57) your papers and they turn around and you you get a win make sure you got
(2:00:03) your little bill in there for for your lost time from work or any copies that you had to make or any visits to the law library or any what is called real and
(2:00:10) personal damages and don't pad the account put down exactly what you got because if they force you to prove it you can get busted for perjury so I
(2:00:16) don't I don't recommend you you know yeah shall we say stretch the pad
(2:00:21) I recommend you put down exactly what your costs are believe me the fact that they got beats plenty enough of a sting
(2:00:26) and the fact they got to pay a couple hundred dollars for your last day at work will be more of a state and you will not you will get a code on your
(2:00:32) license and the next time you get pulled over they will just see in your license bag and tell you think about slowing down and have a nice day because they
(2:00:38) don't like people like you because you're an American and Americans don't give up they never
(2:00:44) surrender and they fight one judge told me one time he said you got any kind of idea how much money you crossed this card today and I said I hope it was a
(2:00:50) bunch of your honor because I hope you got to go write a whole bunch more tickets to break even I way I figure the
(2:00:55) more tickets you got to write the sooner the Public's gonna wake up to this uh theft and maybe they'll start doing something
(2:01:02) positive to stop this kind of stuff because it's my my belief they should be having masks on out there because I mean
(2:01:08) if they wasn't out of script they'd be having a mask on there when they robbed the people okay
(2:01:14) well he didn't he didn't like that answer too good but the bottom line is he he knew I was right and after a while
(2:01:19) they realized what your goals are and you know hey this is more fun than Edgewater Park and I want to go on all the rides twice you know what I mean I
(2:01:26) want to hit the wild mouse and a whole bunch of them other rides let's do it and see when they see that they realize
(2:01:32) there's no point you're not going to learn anything you're going to cost some time money materials now the the system is not profitable
(2:01:39) okay so they back off they put a code on your license it won't bother you anymore and everybody see we took take that line
(2:01:46) down we take the line from the Constitution we take the line from the right now let's think up on the other right how about the right to work
(2:01:52) contract your labor and your skill in your time of life as you see fit now your right to work is protected by
(2:01:58) the Constitution under the First Amendment again you have a right to work and contract your labor and your skill in your time
(2:02:04) of life as you see fit I get hauled into court before the edge of this big Court here in Oakland County I won't give you
(2:02:11) the judge's name because he was a fair judge and a good judge and I'm going to let him slide but the bottom line is this he looked just like Abe Lincoln I
(2:02:17) mean exactly he was the spitting image and he leans over the chair and he says
(2:02:22) well he says it's been reported to me son that you
(2:02:28) don't have a license to practice law is that correct and I looked up at him and I said judge I'm not practicing I know what the hell
(2:02:34) I'm doing and the whole Court broke out laughing he said that's pretty good that's pretty good I like somebody with a sense of
(2:02:40) humor he said but that doesn't change anything son you have to have a license to
(2:02:45) practice law and I said your honor I'm an unenfranchised common law free man I live at the common law I am not a
(2:02:51) participant anytime teen schemes a limited liability and a joint venture for private with an insurable interest require me to participate in these
(2:02:57) illegal corporate Pharmacy schemes I am just Joe Blow from Kokomo down on the street I just live at the common law and
(2:03:04) I have a right to work and contract my labor my skill and my time of life as I see fit not some third party arbitrary
(2:03:10) and capricious Bar Association sees fit and they had loaded the court with all these attorneys and they were oh
(2:03:19) I said your honor the state of Michigan arbitrarily and erroneously converted my right to work
(2:03:25) into a privilege and issued a license and a fee for it that's unconstitutionally around our Marbury
(2:03:31) versus Madison 5us137 1803 anything in conflict or repugnance
(2:03:36) season I'll avoid of law okay can you see that remember Ray versus Madison and
(2:03:42) since the state converted my right into privilege and issued a license and a fee for it we're not business Pennsylvania no state may convert a secured Liberty
(2:03:49) and their privilege and issue a license and a fee for it and if they do Shuttlesworth versus Birmingham Alabama says I may ignore the
(2:03:55) license of the fee and engage and they're right with impunity that means you can't punish me in U.S versus Bishop Court 12 U.S 346
(2:04:02) defines globalness as an evil mode of intent to avoid a known due to your task under the law with a moral certainty I submit your honor I couldn't have done
(2:04:08) an evil test because I was totally following the constitution in the U.S Supreme Court I would submit the prosecution council's
(2:04:15) burdens to prove that I did willfully annoyingly avoid a known due to your task under the law and namely to get the license and I would submit a
(2:04:21) specifically precluded he cannot perform his task and therefore I had motion for dismissal with prejudice Pharisee the cause of action for which relief can be
(2:04:27) granted and I'd kind of like to collect my costs and fees for having to defend this frivolous spurious complaint the
(2:04:34) judge rolls back in his chair with a great big smile and he turns the council for the prosecution he says well I'm
(2:04:39) missiles what do you think we ought to do about this young gentleman the prosecution mounts back how about we
(2:04:45) honor the motion to dismiss your honor the judge says good answer because I don't think you're ready for this kid today and the whole Court broke out
(2:04:52) laughing an old gentleman walked up to me and he said son I just want to shake your hand and tell you
(2:04:58) you gotta have like King Kong because you just slammed the bar
(2:05:03) association right into the ground on top of that I've been an attorney for 57 years and I
(2:05:09) just want to shake your answer and tell you that was one of the most magnificent arguments that I've ever had the privilege to hear in a court of law
(2:05:16) now he was an asked attorney and he realized what kind of a chain was around his ankle with this bar association and
(2:05:23) these lawyers they resent that they really do they're people just like you they don't like to have any chains on
(2:05:28) them but they had had anybody quite show them how to get those chains off
(2:05:34) and when they saw somebody do it in their own skill with their own you know with their own cards on their own
(2:05:40) playing field it actually impressed the hell out of them I had several gentlemen come up and shake my hand that day
(2:05:45) needless to say the case was dismissed and I've been helping little people getting jammed for years
(2:05:51) every time I see some little person get jammed I'm out there flipping that wrench zingizing easy
(2:05:58) and I flipped that wrench at him so good usually they just back off Dr cavarkin
(2:06:05) was a perfect example the poor man was just trying to help these poor people they were jamming him Every Which Way
(2:06:11) but Loose so what we did is we taught him a thing called corento
(2:06:17) I got a hold of his attorney and submitted all of the arguments all right now we're going to bring up several arguments right here
(2:06:24) we're gonna bring up police powers and we're gonna bring up corrento
(2:06:30) what we're on to is a basic right that goes back to English law ancient English law
(2:06:37) it's right here we're on florento
(2:06:44) in Old English practice a writ in a nature of a writ of right for the king
(2:06:50) against him who claimed or assured any office franchise or Liberty to inquire by what
(2:06:58) Authority is he supported his claim in order to
(2:07:03) determine the right it lay also in the case of a non-user or long neglected no
(2:07:09) long neglect of a franchise franchises Corporation or misuser or abuser of a
(2:07:15) franchise being a writ commanding the defendant to show by what warrant he
(2:07:21) exercises such a corporate franchise having never had any Grant of it or
(2:07:27) having forfeited it by neglect or abuse a common law writ designed to test
(2:07:33) whether a person exercising power is legally entitled to do so an extraordinary proceeding prerogative in
(2:07:39) nature addressed to preventing a continued exercise of authority unlawfully asserted
(2:07:46) Johnson versus Manhattan Railroad Company New York recorded at volume 289
(2:07:51) United States page 479. now it is intended to prevent exercise of powers
(2:07:58) that are not conferred by law and is not ordinarily available to regulate the
(2:08:03) manner of exercising such power now what we did
(2:08:09) see police powers are defined as the right amount of domain of a state or political subdivision to enact laws for the common good welfare let's pull that
(2:08:15) out police powers anybody got there
(2:08:21) police power right here state police power
(2:08:26) it's right here police power this is out of blacks Law Dictionary folks
(2:08:31) an authority conferred by the American constitutional system in the 10th Amendment U.S Constitution upon
(2:08:39) the individual states and in turn delegated to the local governments through which they are enabled to
(2:08:45) establish a special Department of police right such laws and regulations says tend to prevent the commission of Fraud
(2:08:53) and or crime and secure generally the Comfort safety morals health and prosperity of its citizens by preserving
(2:09:01) the public order and preventing a conflict of rights in the common intercourse of the citizens and ensuring
(2:09:09) to each and uninterrupted enjoyment yeah everybody will get that word enjoyment
(2:09:15) of all the Privileges conferred upon him or her by the general laws the Constitution the power of the state to
(2:09:22) place restraints on personal freedoms and property rights of persons for the protection of the public safety health
(2:09:29) and morals or to promotion of the public convenience in general propriety the police power is subject to
(2:09:37) limitations of the federal and state constitutions that everybody catch that and especially to the requirements of
(2:09:44) due process police power is the exercise of The Sovereign right of the government to promote order safety security health
(2:09:51) morals and general welfare within constitutional
(2:09:57) limitations right is an essential attribute Marshall versus Kansas City Missouri
(2:10:04) recorded at 35 volume Southwest Second that's another reporter
(2:10:12) Southwest Second Page 877 all right now police powers are the right amendment
(2:10:18) domain of state or political sub Vision to an AG laws for the common gun welfare in a curb crime within constitutional
(2:10:23) limitations and the key words in that whole thing are within constitutional limitation and then it tells you you to
(2:10:29) see the 10th Amendment when you see the 10th Amendment and believe it or not you can go look up the
(2:10:34) books and it divides the 10th Amendment real here pull over here
(2:10:41) the burdens placed on the national government as a result of States regulation okay
(2:10:48) regulation of their Internal Affairs save as Congress may act to remove them
(2:10:53) constitute normal incidents of operation within the same territory of a dual system of government and no immunity of
(2:11:01) national government from such burden is to me implied from the Constitution all
(2:11:07) right all right pen Diaries versus milk Control Commission all right a Pennsylvania case recorded at United's
(2:11:14) uh volume 318 U.S 261 the people of the United States residing within any state
(2:11:21) are subject to two governments one state and the other National but there need be
(2:11:27) no conflict between the two because the powers which one possesses the other
(2:11:32) does not that's United States versus Crookshank a very famous Supreme Court case
(2:11:37) excuse me now foreign
(2:11:47) within the area of delegated powers expressed or implied this amendment does not reduce the powers of the United
(2:11:54) States that's U.S versus Manning recorded at 2 15 Federal supplement
(2:12:00) that's another reporter page 272. the Federal Union has only those Powers expressly conferred on it and those
(2:12:07) reasonably implied from powers granted while each state has all governmental
(2:12:12) Powers except such as the People by the Constitution have conferred on the United States
(2:12:19) denied to the state are reserved to the people themselves Anderson versus
(2:12:24) Gladden recorded at volume 188 Federal supplement 666 it's bed number
(2:12:32) all right it is when Federal legislation attempts to confer power upon the
(2:12:37) national government that it is not within it's not within the express or implied
(2:12:44) power is given by the Constitution that the legislation becomes vulnerable to
(2:12:50) this amendment okay now what are we talking about here Brady Bill huh
(2:12:56) within their powers they have no 10th Amendment powers to take away the Second Amendment does that make sense to everybody they
(2:13:03) don't have any powers to go and take away the Second Amendment or any other Amendment the Fourth Amendment the Fifth
(2:13:08) Amendment nothing and the Ninth Amendment precluded them from adding on to the constitution in such a way that would take away the powers so by the
(2:13:15) Ninth Amendment and the Tenth Amendment they're totally locked out from doing a lot of the things that they do but see you got to know that and be able to
(2:13:20) timely exercise it so it's very important to understand your tenth amendment Powers now when in the course
(2:13:26) of human events it becomes necessary and proper and this is what we did this is what we
(2:13:32) did to help out Dr Kevorkian we made sure that his lawyer got this knowledge
(2:13:38) we went in there and we dug up a writ of what we're until
(2:13:44) a rid of corento all right now this doesn't look like much but let me tell
(2:13:49) you something what we're talking about doing here see most cities at least in the state of Michigan are by Public Act 230 public
(2:13:56) Acts or Public Act 287 or public accent and every one of them there is a rights and power section usually it's recorded
(2:14:02) at 2.2 or 3.1 and it basically says and I quote subject to the Constitution of
(2:14:07) the United States and the general laws of the state of Michigan the city of or the township of has rights and Powers
(2:14:14) too and then it starts listing the rights and Powers right to have a police department right to have a fire department right to have a city all
(2:14:20) right and it starts listing all these Powers now the antithesis to the argument is that if they're not within
(2:14:25) the Constitution of the United States and the general laws of the state of Michigan they don't have any rights and powers does that make sense to everybody
(2:14:31) in other words they're in violation of their corporate charter their franchise and they promised they would be within
(2:14:37) the Constitution of the United States and the general laws of the state of Michigan now a lot of people they don't understand the power of this
(2:14:43) argument so I want to really push this one home I want you to understand whenever these little townships and
(2:14:48) these little cities and what have you they start acting like King Farooq and that you're you're you don't matter and they don't got to listen to you this is
(2:14:54) what I want you to do you ask them a point question and asked them are you violating my constitutionally secured
(2:14:59) civil rights by however you claim they are because if you are you have just waved
(2:15:05) your right to be the city of and I'll laugh at you for a little bit okay and you explain to him Public Act
(2:15:12) 230 of public acts which states the rights and power sections of the Constitution of the United States and the general laws of the state of
(2:15:18) Michigan you have rights and Powers the anti-thesis to that argument is if you're not going to be within the Constitution of the United States or the
(2:15:24) general laws of the state of Michigan and you're going to violate my constitutional rights and trample my rights what we're going to do here is
(2:15:29) we're going to go for a writ of mandamus in quo warranto that's the legal term fancy legal term
(2:15:37) but it is an ancient law that goes way back to England in the ancient times and basically here is a judgment in a
(2:15:43) capious action for it right you put down here the case the case came
(2:15:49) on regularly for trial before the honorable and you put the judge's name in there whatever it is on a jury trailer non-jury trial dated such and
(2:15:56) such the name appear it is for your counsel in the name of period for opposing counsel right the court heard
(2:16:01) the testimony and examined the proofs offered by the parties the court
(2:16:06) considered itself fully advised in the premise filed in its findings of fact
(2:16:12) and conclusions of Law and directed The judgments be entered in accordance with such findings right
(2:16:18) which means they figured out that they violated your constitutional rights they didn't have a right to violate your constitution rights and in the hearing
(2:16:24) you showed they violated your constitutional rights and the judge figured out they violated your constitutional rights so now for your
(2:16:30) relief we're going to get this core rental and this is exactly what happened to The Honorable doctor
(2:16:37) Kevorkian you'll notice that he was in jail and they were hammering the tail at him the next thing you know everything got real quiet nobody said nothing
(2:16:44) and then the next thing you know they were letting him go and they were minding their business now this is how it happened
(2:16:50) it is therefore ordered in a judged and decreed one defendant Corporation the
(2:16:55) city of you put down what name has violated provisions of the act under which it was created and also has
(2:17:02) violated provisions of Public Act 230 or Public Act section 2.2 rights and power section in other words it didn't uphold
(2:17:08) the Constitution of the United States to the general laws of the state of Michigan defendant Corporation the city of whatever Pontiac whatever
(2:17:15) accordingly has forfeited its Charter and become liable to be dissolved by the abuse of
(2:17:21) its power how much money am I talking about here folks we'd be in about nine decimal places
(2:17:28) plus wouldn't you understand now do you think they're going to buy some little doctor when they're looking at
(2:17:33) shutting down a new city what do you think is going to happen everything's going to get quiet they're
(2:17:40) going to let the good doctor go same thing for you now [Music]
(2:17:45) defendant Corporation you name them therefore is dissolved in the corporate rights Privileges and franchise of
(2:17:50) Defense are declared forfeited to the people defendant Corporation you name them as
(2:17:56) trustees directors managers and other official officers attorneys and agents are forever restrained and enjoying from
(2:18:03) exercising any of the corporate franchise Powers rights and or privileges previously
(2:18:08) exercised by defendant said City and from collecting or receiving any debts
(2:18:14) and or demands belonging to or held by defendant City whatever and from paying
(2:18:22) out or in any manner interfering with transferring or delivering to any person
(2:18:29) any of the deposits money Securities property and effects of the defendant City or held by it
(2:18:36) you name a trustee which the state would do probably the Attorney General after
(2:18:41) your complaint is filed is appointed receiver of all of the property real and
(2:18:47) personal things in action and effects of defendant City Corporation held by
(2:18:52) invested in defendants or in or to which defendant may be in any wise interested
(2:18:59) or entitled there too plaintiff the people of the state of whatever that's US state of Michigan
(2:19:05) shall recover of defendant Corporation whatever city of the sum of
(2:19:11) Damages real and personal got me they don't like that when you start talking out because they can go 100 million three times that amount punitive damage
(2:19:17) as they get a little upset as costs and disbursements of this action and the receivers is directed to
(2:19:25) pay the sum out of their pocket to whoever the Attorney General but you can
(2:19:31) have a person stipulated on there as an injured party now you put down there
(2:19:37) the honorable Judge so-and-so presiding
(2:19:42) the date entered and use he signs it and that city is no
(2:19:48) longer a city you see when they violate your Constitution this is one of the most
(2:19:54) powerful tools that you can use and when you jam this on you better wear a bulletproof vest to cart that you're
(2:20:00) probably gonna get shot at by the time you get home but it's nice to threaten you know you just thread just drop one of them in the
(2:20:08) mail and say if I don't get reasonable cause for my action in the near future you're going to get one of these in the mail for real
(2:20:13) here is a summons for quaranto this is for the start of the thing right
(2:20:20) here summons form 41 by the way you can get this in 21 amgiers
(2:20:27) forms and practice you're practical and practical forms and
(2:20:32) practice all right you name the party you put down there who you are the people of the
(2:20:37) state of Michigan versus you are summoned to appear before what's In which court and such and such a date to
(2:20:43) show by what Authority you claim to have use and or enjoy the rights and Liberties and franchise namely the
(2:20:48) corporation city of set out and complained of in such and such a Time summons and further to do and receive
(2:20:55) all things which the court shall then order concerning you
(2:21:01) this is kind of like pulling their driver's license for drunk driving now that's an oversimplification
(2:21:08) but sometimes these City uh Halls operate like a drunken sailor
(2:21:13) and they just think they can abuse citizens rights and trash them you know who I am alone I don't care
(2:21:22) you know who I am I'm your boss I'm the people you're elected to work for me
(2:21:29) and I'm trying to be nice so I'd appreciate it if you just we can sit down and work this out but if we can't
(2:21:35) work this out I'm gonna sack it to you baby you got me and that's basically how I feel about it now we can get into some
(2:21:42) of these other things right here this is a very important point I'm trying to get this across to
(2:21:49) people and you try and tell them and they kind of look at you with this blank Starry Eyed look
(2:21:54) but in the constitution of the state of Michigan the latest and greatest the very first thing they talk about notice
(2:22:00) it says section one all political power is inherent in the
(2:22:05) people government is instituted for their equal benefits security and
(2:22:11) protection now let me ask you a question do you feel equal benefit I don't
(2:22:17) you know equal protection and discrimination no person shall be denied the eagle protection of the laws
(2:22:23) right nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of the Civil or political
(2:22:29) rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of religion
(2:22:34) race color or national origin the legislature shall implement this section by appropriate legislation
(2:22:41) you know and they start going down through all the freedom of worship you know I mean this is what we're
(2:22:49) talking about here folks you know your rights you got them you don't know him you know them
(2:22:54) you get back in here to police Powers generally this is something you gotta understand generally the police power is the
(2:23:01) exercise of The Sovereign right of the government to promote order safety and health and morals and the general welfare of the society within
(2:23:08) constitutional limits within constitutional limits that everybody at within constitutional limits generally
(2:23:13) the police power is the exercise of The Sovereign right of the government to promote order safety health and moral and general welfare of society within
(2:23:20) the Constitutional limits as otherwise stated the police power of the state is a power or organization of a system of
(2:23:29) regulations to Foster the health order and comfort of the people and to prevent and or punish
(2:23:35) injuries and offenses to the public right but it has to be within constitutional
(2:23:41) limitations and it Embraces all rules for the protection of life liberty and property
(2:23:47) I mean that's a contradiction of logic today folks that doesn't happen you and
(2:23:52) I both know it I mean who are they kidding they ain't kidding me
(2:23:57) okay so it's up to you and it's up to me and we got to get a hold of this book right
(2:24:03) here you can hold this Constitution and you start learning that Constitution and you
(2:24:08) quote a chapter and verse and guess what you'll notice a unique different change one after a while they start to listen
(2:24:16) and you actually affect what is called positive chain and every time they see you and that
(2:24:22) goofy hat you wear they go huh for God's sake don't give that guy no
(2:24:27) ticket I have actually been pulled over listening to the program didn't have no
(2:24:33) plates on my card policeman called he says you got positive idea in a guy and a friend of
(2:24:39) mine was taping in office police radio he said yeah it's him he said well for God's sake don't give
(2:24:44) that guy no ticket and the guy says sorry she ain't got no plates on his car said I don't give a
(2:24:50) damn money and got on his car don't give that guy no ticket he said but Sergey told me he's just
(2:24:56) been waiting to fight it and beat it all the way to the Supreme Court and I wrote that on the ticket he says you give that guy a ticket I said I just told you not
(2:25:01) to give that guy a ticket what do you tap you got some problem with your hearing said I told you not to give that guy a
(2:25:08) ticket now why did you give that guy a ticket he's searching and no plates on the car I said I told you I don't care what he ain't got on the car
(2:25:13) this is all recorded on a radio broadcast so the everybody was laughing the police
(2:25:20) were laughing everybody was laughing his buddies were laughing they were ripping him over the radio the sergeant told him all right knock it off clear the net
(2:25:26) this is serious he said uh fine he said you give him a ticket he says fine he says tomorrow
(2:25:32) morning 9 o'clock I want you to be in here when the city attorney comes in here and he says you're gonna personally deliver the ticket him and he ain't
(2:25:37) gonna be real happy with you because he hates that guy every time he goes to court that guy blows his doors
(2:25:43) off he looks like a fool you give the guy a ticket now he's got to go to court
(2:25:48) so sure enough we go to court come up before the court
(2:25:54) judge starts operating like a prosecutor he starts asking me all kind of Discovery question I call him as soon as
(2:25:59) they call the case now this is something important you gotta understand you're going to be your own attorney and you got to know all the programming when you
(2:26:05) hear him call your case you get off your tail feather and you run right up there as quick and as speedingly as possible
(2:26:10) without knocking anybody down and you say ready your honor who State your appearance I'm so-and-so hearing before
(2:26:17) this honorable Court I am standing as my own Council in my state it's under Article 1 Section 13. I've appointed
(2:26:22) myself my own attorney and I'm ready to proceed with my administrative procedural matters and at this time you honor may please record I motion for
(2:26:28) dismissal with prejudice failure state of cause of action virtue week when you granted Bingo no I apologize if I'm talking too fast I'm
(2:26:34) gonna try and slow down a little bit but when you when you're in court as much as I am you just learn you need to talk faster you lose so I apologize if I'm
(2:26:42) going a little too fast I'm gonna slow down I'm trying to make it easier for you folks okay
(2:26:47) but the judge gets off right away well you got to take it untouched I said well your honor I said are you the judge the
(2:26:53) disinterested third party it is true in this case the tire effect he said yes I said okay I said is this the
(2:27:00) prosecutor over here to my right he said yeah that's him I said okay I said are you gonna
(2:27:06) prosecute this case your honor he said no no I'm the judge I said why are you asking Discovery questions
(2:27:12) well I just want to find out what's going on I says isn't that his job over there that's what he's supposed to do he's supposed to present his case as the
(2:27:19) prosecutor Trier of the case you're the Trier effect he's the Trier of the case
(2:27:24) so if you're going to operate as the judge and the prosecutor I'm going to object on the record as a mistrial
(2:27:32) he said okay I'll let you enter that on the record go ahead I said okay let it be entered on the record as an appealable issue he said okay he said

(2:27:49) course all the people on the court oh this guy's going to deal watch this this is going to be good
(2:27:55) he says to me he says I assume you have a very good reason for that and I said yes sir and I shut up
(2:28:02) I waited he said can I hear it I said well your honor I said I'm an
(2:28:09) unfranchise common law free man I'm not a participant in any time teams games a limited liability and a joint venture
(2:28:15) for profit with an insurable interest require me to participate in these corporate Ponzi schemes I'm Just a
(2:28:20) Little Joe from Kokomo I live on the Block I travel at the common law
(2:28:26) and I have a right to travel free The Uncommon pursuant to Shapiro versus Thompson and that rate is so basic it
(2:28:31) doesn't even need to be mentioned the state of Michigan arbitrary and erroneously converted my right into a
(2:28:36) privilege initiative license plate and a fee for it Murdock versus Pennsylvania says no state may converted secured Liberty and
(2:28:42) a privilege and issue license and a fee for it and if they do Shuttlesworth versus Birmingham Alabama says I can ignore the license and engage and arrive
(2:28:48) with impunity that means you can't punish me since I relied on previous decisions of the U.S Supreme Court and
(2:28:53) on constitutional defenses I have a perfect defense for willfulness I am immune to the prosecution therefore
(2:29:00) prosecution Council does not have a cause of action for which relief can be granted that motion for dismissal with prejudice for various data cause of
(2:29:06) action for what's relief for me granted Knight kind of like to collect my costs and fees for having to defend this frivolous case
(2:29:12) the judge starts reading the ticket told officer he'd just been waiting to get this ticket so he could fight it and
(2:29:18) beat it all the way to the Supreme Court he laughed he says
(2:29:23) motion grad and he ran off the bench before I could get my damages so I went out in the hall he went to the
(2:29:30) can I waited for him he came out of the can I served him with my papers he says you didn't have to do that I swear I
(2:29:35) didn't want you to be inconvenience judge he said okay he signed I went back into
(2:29:41) court as a casual thing just to see what kind of reaction would happen and I sat down about two cases later this elderly
(2:29:47) gentleman gets up and he stands up there and he says your honor I'm not quite as knowledgeable as that young gentleman
(2:29:53) that was here just two cases ago and I don't presume to understand all of the issues that he raised but it really
(2:29:59) sounded good to me and I kind of like the ditto everything he said on top of my case everybody broke a laughing
(2:30:05) the Chad says all right I'm gonna get any guys here didn't have no plates on her care about Five Guys raised their hand he says okay everybody dismissed
(2:30:11) get the hell out of here and everybody broke out laughing it was like you know at the carnival on
(2:30:18) Christmas or something you know it was a carnival atmosphere so I'm telling you you
(2:30:24) could change and see they at all face that watches on and then all of a sudden boom I'll
(2:30:29) jump and I mean I'm telling you it's this little book right here this book you know what's in this book you have
(2:30:34) power knowledge is power you know what's in this book and you know how to exercise your rights in a
(2:30:40) timely fashion you have constitutional rights and if you exercise them and you utilize
(2:30:47) good judgment and be courteous and just treat people the way you like to be treated with a little dignity most of
(2:30:53) the time 99 of the time I win now I will tell you I've been to jail I mean I'm
(2:30:58) not going to lie to you I've been but when I go to jail they really hate it because I usually get oh the last time I got Five Guys cases
(2:31:06) retried and I got another four guys out like within 24 hours and then I got 11 guys off of their case because they
(2:31:11) signed up for drug rehab and One bank robber come up to me and said to me I think you know I'm a hard case yeah I
(2:31:18) kind of get it and he says I want you to know you changed my life he said I really appreciate you helping me with my paperwork he says
(2:31:25) they're gonna give me a new chance they're gonna let me out on probation I'm gonna marry my girlfriend and he
(2:31:31) started crying and he basically said I'll never forget you Pops he says you're some kind of guy he says God
(2:31:38) bless you and he says I want you to know I I really appreciate what you did and I found God too and between you and crazy
(2:31:45) Charlie he said the Crazy Charlie is a minister that goes around to all the jails he used to ride through the Outlaw
(2:31:51) motorcycle game Crazy Charlie is clearly crazy last time I saw Crazy Charlie was riding down
(2:31:57) Eight Mile Road at 85 miles an hour standing on his seat against another guy I'm just standing on
(2:32:03) his seat and see who was gonna wimp out first Crazy Charlie did about five years in
(2:32:08) the slam because he got charged with murdering some guy crazy chair we went to Geo and he found
(2:32:14) God and God Spirit Crazy Charlie from a life sentence in jail and crazy Charlie owes
(2:32:20) it to God and he goes through all of the jails and he preaches the gospel and he
(2:32:25) basically is quite a gentleman and he's nobody to screw with and when we went to Chapel the kids were
(2:32:30) all joking around perhaps you going to chat but I said oh hell yeah he says perhaps you're a badass would
(2:32:37) you want to go to Chapel for us let me tell you something my man you can always learn something and I'll tell you one of the best places to learn it is our
(2:32:43) Chapel so why don't you come on down and you might learn something we go down there and who
(2:32:50) so what the hell are you doing here so I don't want to talk about it crazy Charlie
(2:32:57) the guy turns around to me says pops is there anybody in this joint you don't know I said I'll tell you what this guy
(2:33:03) this guy would listen to because he's serious a man is serious and he found God and
(2:33:10) he's going to try and help you find God and in the end you will have peace well with this gentleman This One bank robber
(2:33:16) found this gentleman in between myself and crazy Charlie he found God and I wish you could see the piece on his face
(2:33:22) he was in a lot of trouble and uh we did his paperwork for him we helped him and basically they they redid
(2:33:30) his whole program and because he found God they they decided to put him out on a lifetime parole he made restitution he
(2:33:36) gave the money back he changed his whole life his whole life was changed just from that instance so
(2:33:43) I'm telling you you go when I go into jail it's hilarious because it's like
(2:33:50) the jailers don't even know how to act and it's like I and then when the other told me when I left he shook my hand he
(2:33:55) says I'm gonna miss you Pops he said they call me pops because I'm older I was a little teed off when they called
(2:34:00) me perhaps the first time so I told this kid he said I said what's with the faps
(2:34:07) I said I bet you can't even do 25 push-ups he said you proudly right pops can you boom down I went 25 out and
(2:34:14) here's how raise your 25 and here's another 25. perhaps you in good shape I said I'm going to show you how good a
(2:34:20) shape I mean you keep calling me pops he says no no no no you don't understand pops he said if you're an older
(2:34:26) gentleman in the joint they treat you with courtesy they call you Pops that's just out of courtesy I said oh I guess
(2:34:31) you can call me pops and that's cool so don't you ever think that I'm getting old
(2:34:37) South for you so they laughed when I left they lined up to shake my hand and uh even the
(2:34:43) Jailer said he was going to be sorry I meant to see me go because I was helping so many people and people were getting
(2:34:48) their lives together and so when I go to jail it's kind of unique I actually get a vacation I got the top hunk and I laid
(2:34:55) on the window and let God's sunshine in my face and I got a suntan and guys would say pops why do you climb up on
(2:35:00) the top punk I said man I'm out on the beach getting sun and raised what are you doing he said you know pops you something else
(2:35:06) you're gonna make you in jail and you're gonna make I said I'm laying out here on the beach what you talking about
(2:35:12) I'm laying on my bed right next to the window and the Sun comes right through and I'm on the beach what are you talking about getting the sun tan
(2:35:20) so you got to make the best of where you're at no matter what it keeps your spirits up
(2:35:25) and the bottom line is this I wouldn't have been in jail if I could have more effectively argued my
(2:35:31) Constitution I ended up having to do a brief from the jail 28 pages I sharpen the pencil on the
(2:35:38) phone on the wall there it is this is a 28-page motion Edition this is
(2:35:44) more than that this right here this right here I mean this is all
(2:35:50) from hand longhand and when we got to court the judge looked at it he goes sir
(2:35:55) are you an attorney I says no he says he says uh you've been to law school I
(2:36:03) says no sir he says you did this from jail I says yes sir he says you did this from jail
(2:36:09) from memory I says yes sir that's rather extensive it's huge meanwhile the prosecutor kicks in she
(2:36:16) says Joshua I got to answer this he goes oh hell this guy is kind of like this guy on night court on TV and channel 2
(2:36:21) kind of flip it and he says oh hell yeah counselor he says what's this a new hobby you just
(2:36:28) took up he says uh this guy even did his own proposed order I don't even have to fill out an order
(2:36:33) he says not only and I want it done by 8 o'clock Monday morning so all weekend she had to go to law library and answer all this stuff
(2:36:40) she was not a happy camper so then she uh proposed that I have to have a shrink check my bolts out to see if my
(2:36:47) batteries are charged because if you defend your Constitution you got to be a crazy uh turkey
(2:36:55) and she found out I'm pretty well squared away I just argue my Constitution I asked the
(2:37:01) judges this is a God in this bad yet judge so what do you got touched in a nut house because you defend your Constitution he says not in my court and
(2:37:07) I've heard of Judges speaking out and saying well the Constitution has no place in my courtroom how can they even
(2:37:13) think about that wait where that is a that is a very serious statement
(2:37:21) because what that judge just did in an open court alone or Title 18 United States code section 2381 as he just
(2:37:28) committed an act of treason see the judges sworn under article 11 in this state paragraph one and he will
(2:37:34) uphold the Constitution of the United States and move as most immediately as is practicable defend the Constitution and a violation of that act
(2:37:41) would be Capital felony treason under the people and government of the United States of America and he would be subject and upon conviction to be hung
(2:37:48) by the neck that's how serious if the defendant had a driver's license and they were trying to argue a traffic
(2:37:53) matter and they were kind of in the system already and raised the Constitutional objection that the judge
(2:37:58) might say it doesn't apply well here's here's how we start a lot of these traffic cases and I'll get right into that the issue when you first walk
(2:38:05) before a traffic court you see when they merge these courts together in 1963 they
(2:38:11) screwed up they they wanted they wanted to lay off after judges see and they only wanted to have one building so what
(2:38:17) they did is they merged the traffic court per se or the or that docket into
(2:38:22) the criminal court docket and when they did that they didn't check the rules
(2:38:28) you see and when they didn't check the rules they didn't allow for jurisdictional challenges between the
(2:38:34) two courts so what happens now is you come before the court and there's
(2:38:40) several ways you can come before the court no this gentleman here is correct when he's talking about you have a
(2:38:46) driver's license you have entered into a contractual relationship with the state
(2:38:52) in other words it's not a lawful contract because you cannot enter into an unlawful contract you understand it
(2:38:58) is a contract though because it's recognized as a contract because you have voluntarily entered
(2:39:05) into this contract you agreed to all of the rules in their law book for that
(2:39:10) contract now this is what we call admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction or artificial jurisdiction
(2:39:16) and it's a rather heavy argument going into area railroad versus Tompkins and McCulloch versus Maryland and we'll go
(2:39:22) into that in depth at the end of this program but I wanted to share with you briefly when you sign your driver's license and
(2:39:29) especially today and your voter's registration card you will notice a little note right under
(2:39:36) your signature where you agree to the acceptance of The Duality of
(2:39:41) citizenship of not only at the common law but you accept the national jurisdiction under admiralty and
(2:39:47) Maritime jurisdiction which allows you to be sucked into all these Uniform Commercial Code requirements
(2:39:53) and this is a very serious thing you're saying here you don't understand it but you just sold all your constitutional
(2:39:59) rights down the sewer when you signed that document so when you sign it my honest advice and this is a firm
(2:40:05) experience you sign the thing and right at the end of your name you write
(2:40:10) UD U period D period at the end of your name and underneath your name you write
(2:40:16) 1-207 without prejudice now what that does it says I'll be glad to accept your
(2:40:22) uh your ridiculous privilege I don't really need to but I will just to keep myself from being in trouble with the
(2:40:27) cops and I'll tell you what we'll do we'll uh we'll exercise our Uniform Commercial
(2:40:34) Code caveat that allows us to keep all of our constitutional rights in other words my signature is not really a
(2:40:39) signature of contract it's a signature of convenience that allows me to get a piece of paper
(2:40:45) to put in my pocket for identification purposes that allows me to sign my checks and do whatever I got to do
(2:40:51) but it doesn't in any way make any admissions or confessions or require me to participate in any of your rulebook
(2:40:57) schemes under your admiralty and Maritime taunting scheme now to tell you how crazy it was I just got discussed by an attorney
(2:41:03) how he would defend how he would defend a program where a gentleman that he was defending
(2:41:11) was accused of hijacking a car and that they were claiming that because the car is made all over the world and all over
(2:41:17) the United States that the parts even though they're assembled at one point they are in what is called
(2:41:23) the the interstate
(2:41:29) jurisdiction and that because of that this current this crime was now a federal crime you
(2:41:35) understand this is how far reaching this thing has gotten and when this gentleman signed his driver's license he had no idea that he
(2:41:42) was entering into this thing and waving all of his god-given constitutional rights and that he was no longer a
(2:41:48) common law citizen that he was actually under annualty in Maritime jurisdiction now
(2:41:53) when we pull up some of these statutory requirements it's an interesting thing that you brought up
(2:41:59) but what they do is they're never these regulations are never enacted into law
(2:42:04) uh we'll show you something on that just a little bit later but they're not an accidental law they just make a
(2:42:09) regulation and because you you voluntarily enter into this contract all of these regulations just come up as
(2:42:16) enforceable to you even though you don't know any better now we have a Fair Credit Reporting Act
(2:42:22) that says if you make any loan or you get involved in any kind of a credit relationship they got to tell you everything about how much the interest
(2:42:28) rate is what the payments are how long the payments I mean they got to tell you every single thing about the contract
(2:42:33) and in theory all contracts you're supposed you're supposed to know all of the facts in
(2:42:39) regard to the contract they just make the contract one-sided and they figure well these people are not that we're informed they're not real bright we'll
(2:42:46) just get them to sign the senator driver's license and they'll voluntarily acquiesce into the situation and then we can throw all of these regulations at
(2:42:51) them and they'll never know how we we hit them so it's very important that you understand when you sign something read
(2:42:57) it for sure if you don't understand everything that's down there take it to somebody and ask some questions before you sign
(2:43:04) it because once you sign it it's harder to get out of
(2:43:09) but I highly recommend everybody lose their wallet and go down and redo their driver's license and sign a thing UD
(2:43:14) when you sign it and put 1-207 without prejudice because right then and there
(2:43:19) you cut off all of this admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction and you return back to your contract law
(2:43:27) of what you're a common law citizen living at the common law
(2:43:32) and they can have their contract but it's not enforceable why is it not enforceable because you can state that
(2:43:37) you sign it under duress well how do I know that look I put UD right after my name you period we think that means
(2:43:43) under development under the deck that means that means under duress
(2:43:52) when I signed this I was under duress I didn't voluntarily sign this I had to sign this or the cops were going to Cuff
(2:43:58) me about the head you see I was under threat intimidation
(2:44:04) coercion I still believe that I have a right to travel freely uncumber notice you're not driving you have a right to
(2:44:09) travel the customary usage of the right to travel today is you get in the car you don't go down to 7-Eleven on your
(2:44:15) bicycle you get in your car I want to go down and pick up a carton of milk you get in your car another unique argument
(2:44:20) along these lines is well judge I asked this judge I says let me ask you a question judge if I get in my car
(2:44:27) the Constitution was still in effect in full force before I got in my car right oh yeah now when I got in my car and I
(2:44:34) had my gun it was still in effect right but when I closed the door
(2:44:40) the Constitution was suspended and everybody broke out laughing how could that be
(2:44:47) the act of getting in the car and closing the door made the Second Amendment unconstitutional
(2:44:52) I said that's totally ludicrous how could that possibly be
(2:45:01) you see they have passed these laws and when they've gotten away with it for so long that they just it's kind of like a bank
(2:45:08) robber that's robbed 25 banks in a row and on the 26 is a little miffed at you getting excited man I've done this 25
(2:45:13) times what's the big deal now you're going to bust me on the 26th time and you're going to get all upset
(2:45:21) see they've been getting away with it so long nobody's ever taken them to the task or they feel like well I should be
(2:45:27) able to get away with it on the 26th time an unconstitutional Act
(2:45:33) wrongfully done it doesn't matter how many times in a row you did it it's still unconstitutional
(2:45:40) and the reality is a person that's properly motivated properly trained and properly willing to do whatever is
(2:45:45) necessary and proper to defend the Constitution will almost always prevail on the merits and that's what we're
(2:45:50) doing right now and they're sweating on that right now but the reality of this is and you got
(2:45:55) to understand the burden is on you you want your Constitution and you damn
(2:46:01) well better grab a hold of it and you better hold on tight and you don't let go for nothing you read your Constitution you learn
(2:46:07) your Constitution you quote your Constitution chapter and verse frontwards backwards upside down when people come up to you well we want you
(2:46:13) to take a drug test as part of your job huh Go Fish
(2:46:18) are you taking a drug test I'm not required to prove a negative you're required to prove a positive if
(2:46:24) you think I'm doing something negligent fine and you go file papers and you take necessary precautions and what have you
(2:46:29) and we'll go to court I says but I'm not I'm not going to be convicted before the fact and then I got to provide evidence
(2:46:35) that I'm not guilty that's the cart before the horse that's back ass words we're not going to
(2:46:42) do that not only that the Fifth Amendment says I gotta write not to be a participant
(2:46:48) in a compulsory process that's going to make an incriminating situation to be now I'm not nothing to hide and I'm not
(2:46:54) even arguing from what I got to hide I'm arguing from the fact that the right stands and I'm exercising it
(2:47:00) and then I usually ask some simple questions well if they find anything when I get fired
(2:47:05) hell yeah you're gonna be penalized so there are penalties
(2:47:10) and if they find anything would I be criminally prosecuted could be huh
(2:47:17) so why would you want to do some damn stupid thing like that I'll give them a piss test this guy comes up to me at the
(2:47:22) last convention we had and they want to take a test that's the weather now he's uh he's got
(2:47:29) any drugs in his system that's first of all what's in my system is between me and my doctor none of your damn business
(2:47:34) I says I don't take drugs but I got nothing to hide but I'm not going to voluntarily enter in anything what if
(2:47:39) your guy screws up and now you say I Got Drugs now I can't get a job ever what are you kidding me there's some new
(2:47:44) hobby you just took up I'm not going to play that game it is not my burden to prove a negative it is
(2:47:50) your burden to prove a positive if you have a just claim for which relief can be granted you go file your papers and
(2:47:56) we'll sit down and talk but until such time you go fish
(2:48:02) because I'm not gonna play I'm not required to play and I'm not gonna play and if you fire me for the
(2:48:08) exercise of my constitutional right I'm going to tell you about United Miller versus United States which says the
(2:48:13) claim and exercise of a constitutional rights shall not be converted into a crime and you're doing that and you're
(2:48:18) punishing me and if you fire me for it I will sue your socks off and attach everything you own Bank business and
(2:48:23) home now make my day that's how I feel about it so you find another turkey to jerk
(2:48:30) with because I'm not gonna play okay now we want to get into some serious things I want to get into this uh
(2:48:36) this argument about traffic cases this is the most practical way to deal with traffic cases
(2:48:43) when you are pulled over what is happening now you got a policeman he's conducting Discovery anything you say
(2:48:49) can and will be held against you and if you don't think so just keep rattling and it'll all get written down on the
(2:48:55) ticket I found that out told Oscar you just been waiting to get this ticket so we can fight and beat it always be in court ruled that word for word right on
(2:49:01) the ticket so when these people are with you you keep your hatch button and I mean I'm
(2:49:06) guilty I admit that sometimes I rattle on it's been known to happen
(2:49:12) so I'm telling you not to do it you button your hands if you say anything it's yes sir no sir what can I do for
(2:49:18) you and they always like to say going a little fast weren't you I say I need to admit or denying I leave
(2:49:23) you your proofs oh a lawyer yeah I'm not a lawyer but
(2:49:28) I'm smart enough to keep my mouth shut because I realize anything I say is going to be putting down on your paper and say you got to charge you make it
(2:49:34) and I'll see you in court oh you want to go to court oh yeah I always go to court I fight everything Murder One
(2:49:40) kind of like a hobby of mine you know
(2:49:46) well let's see what we get and they walk back to the car and they start right
(2:49:51) or they usually come back and they say well you're going a little fast think about slowing down we're gonna let you go with the warning you gotta have a
(2:49:58) good day thank you officer you have a good day too God bless you and keep you safe
(2:50:04) okay courtesy I can blow their doors off anytime I want still yes sir no sir
(2:50:10) courtesy courtesy Pace you treat people the way you like to be treated nine times out of ten you will benefit
(2:50:16) you treat people like a Yahoo and you're gonna get treated like a Yahoo yourself so I I highly recommend courtesy as a an
(2:50:22) effective way I had a policeman one time tell me you ever eat a flashlight the hard way
(2:50:28) and I looked at him and I said quite frankly officer most of the officers I have run into are
(2:50:35) extremely professional and I treat them with a great deal of courtesy and professionalism because I respect what
(2:50:42) they're doing and that they risk their life every day and at no time when I give an officer
(2:50:47) enough static that he would want them make me eat a flashlight I mean I treat them
(2:50:52) very cordially and I respect what they're trying to do I don't agree with everything they're trying to do because some of the stuff is kind of unlawful
(2:51:00) I said but I will give them the courtesy they have coming he turned to me and he said I'm sorry I
(2:51:07) got a big mouth I didn't mean it you're right I was out of line see you treat people with courtesy and
(2:51:14) nine times out of ten you can even back down some guy that's talking a lot of manure
(2:51:20) but the louder you talk and the more belligerent you talk the more louder and the more belligerent he has to talk it's
(2:51:26) kind of like Newton's third law of physics every action has an opposite opposing reaction you talk crap then
(2:51:31) he's gotta talk crap so my advice to people is don't do that it's unmotivated who's doing this you or him remember the
(2:51:38) best weapon you have is the one right between your ears so use it and watch your mouth don't be talking a
(2:51:45) lot of trash to these policemen they don't need to hear it and they got a bad day he might have a bad day
(2:51:51) best thing to do is say yes or no sir if you got an honest pitch go ahead make my day now we've gone past that you got the
(2:51:58) ticket what are you gonna do well look on the ticket see if he signed it a lot of times they don't sign it
(2:52:04) guess what if he didn't sign it there ain't no sworn complaint how can you defend against the non-sworn complaint
(2:52:11) a lot of times the cop doesn't sign the ticket look open your eyes God gave you a set
(2:52:18) of eyes look yeah this guy didn't sign it today it says under penalty of perjury I I attest
(2:52:25) and certified that this is a true and fact complaint well what happens if you don't sign that it ain't a complaint
(2:52:33) police officer that situation don't they make you sign the tickets sometimes they do if you sign it put UD 1-207 without prejudice
(2:52:40) that's saying that's saying that you you received the complaint that's all that's saying all right so
(2:52:48) one day is 207 it's not an admission of this means that you received the complaint okay
(2:52:55) if you don't sign it he's going to take you to jail that's I mean I realize that it's unconstitutional unless you like
(2:53:01) jail food you know I wouldn't do it I'd sign the thing UD 1-207 without prejudice
(2:53:07) the signature doesn't do anything besides you want to copy the complaint anyway because you want to file a brief
(2:53:12) are you going to file the brief if you don't know what the complaint is right now the next thing you know you have to
(2:53:18) notify the court within the time period and it's usually 10 days one of their dirtiest tricks is you call in and you
(2:53:24) think you got it notice and guess what they claim you didn't call in
(2:53:30) and they go ahead and say you didn't show up and they find you guilty and bingo you're out of there so I recommend
(2:53:37) you call them tell them that you want a formal hearing ask the name of the party
(2:53:42) you are speaking to and who am I speaking to so that you've got a name of
(2:53:48) somebody that works there to verify that you called then immediately a sooner type up a little notice that says I
(2:53:56) State your full name do you hereby request a formal hearing put that in the mail sent certified mail to them
(2:54:03) or run down there and there and walk right in and get them to set up a hearing now you want a formal hearing
(2:54:09) okay now five days before that hearing you are required to serve your papers on opposing Council if you don't do it in a
(2:54:17) timely fashion Michigan General Court rule will sock it to you and you will not be able to enter your briefs now sometimes you can get away with it the
(2:54:23) last minute handing it to him and they won't say nothing but if they want to hear me they can use the 5D Court rule I
(2:54:29) have used it effectively several times
(2:54:34) you gotta look at what it says on the complaint whatever it says mcoa whatever you
(2:54:39) violated and you go down and you you go to the law library you look up Michigan miles laws act you look up exactly what
(2:54:45) they say and then you enter a defense I need to admitting her tonight I leave you to strictest proofs and I'm having a
(2:54:51) court of original jurisdiction but before we go that depending on how you want to play and there's several ways you can go if you want to be the hardest
(2:54:58) nosed that you can be you walk into court and don't send no paper
(2:55:03) [Music] and as soon as they call a case you as
(2:55:08) expediently as possible you move to the far to the to the Forum up there in the front and you say in a loud and clear
(2:55:14) voice ready to run it you state your full name I'm giving my appearance before the court inappropriate Persona
(2:55:20) which means in your own proper person in this state it's pursuant Article 1 Section 13. I've appointed myself my own
(2:55:26) attorney and I'm ready to proceed with my administrative procedural matters and at this time your honor may please record I'd motion for dismissal with
(2:55:31) prejudice Fair State and cause of action for which relief can be granted and all of a sudden the cop will go especially
(2:55:36) if you wear a army jacket and you look like you're three sheets in the Wind
(2:55:42) the cop will lean back and go oh crap we're going to get sued I didn't know the guy was a lawyer and
(2:55:47) then he'll start talking to the prosecution Rodney you brought me one of them kind
(2:55:58) I'm gonna get killed and you're gonna sit here and pay for it I promise you and and then what happens is out of your
(2:56:06) mouth you tell a judge in the most clearest and expedient language your honor me to please the court is this the
(2:56:12) court of law or is this a court of equity he will immediately sound off with
(2:56:17) personal Equity here just like he got hit in the knee with a hammer and his leg jump and just that fast it'll happen
(2:56:24) that fast because he thinks there's no lawsuit here therefore there's no equity see the
(2:56:30) judges don't even understand what happened with this shift from 1963 where they move these courts together so you
(2:56:37) got to find out what hat the judge is wearing is he wearing a criminal hat or is he wearing the Civil hat
(2:56:42) so you ever right to ask say justice court of Lars this court Equity he goes there's no equity here
(2:56:48) now we just did this in a beautiful case this little gal she couldn't have been 80 pounds soaking wet and this cap is
(2:56:53) about six foot two about three twenty big heavy duty state trooper she walks in
(2:57:00) your honor I am representing myself as my own counsel I would like to proceed
(2:57:05) with my administrative and procedural matters but before we go I have a declaratory ruling sir could I ask you a
(2:57:13) question oh sure honey go ahead he says but you understand only a fool
(2:57:18) stands as his own attorney she says that may be sir but I'm the best person that knows the facts in my
(2:57:24) case and I think I I have a chance I'd like to try is that okay no problem yeah right
(2:57:31) is this a court of law or is this a court of equity to judge immediately there's no equity here
(2:57:37) she said thank you sir she rolled up her hand and the hand was a ticket that said
(2:57:42) civil and fraction right across the top and she said how may we hear this civil infraction sir
(2:57:48) the judge did a Homer Simpson he goes so that's where you're going when that's
(2:57:54) huh the whole Court broke out laughing this little gal I'm telling you she uses tiny
(2:58:01) little thing she's just a sweetheart the whole Court realized the judge did a Homer Simpson and then the judge
(2:58:07) realized he did a Homer Simpson and then he myself left he goes oh honey you're not gonna pull
(2:58:14) that here today are you she got a little flushed and she wasn't sure she this was her first time she was a little scared
(2:58:21) she looked over at an associate of mine she said looked at him and he go he gave her and he gave her the knot and she
(2:58:28) turned she said yes I am sir and everybody broke all that again the cop goes
(2:58:39) no no you got what's on the ticket that's what's on the complaint you're not changing the complaint after the fact that's perjury you want me to put
(2:58:45) you in a No you can't change the complain the complaint is the complaint you signed and it's true got me if it
(2:58:51) was 50 over you should have wrote 1500 he said well I just don't want to screw around this is just getting out of hand
(2:58:57) I mean she was guilty let's see she goes here in all right
(2:59:03) we haven't even gotten to that yet there's no jurisdiction this is where we're at we're at no jurisdiction
(2:59:10) it says we're right he said are we going to go through with this now come on tell me true she says yes I am sir I'm going
(2:59:16) through all the way all the way to the Supreme Court she said
(2:59:21) and uh the judge goes okay now we're gonna have
(2:59:27) to set a hearing she says a night like a formal hearing too sir he said okay and I like a trial by
(2:59:34) juriser because the value in controversy is in excess of twenty dollars pursuant to the seventh amendment I have a right to trial by jury he says yeah okay okay
(2:59:43) we'll send you notice it's been three and a half weeks we got no notice we call them every day they don't even want to talk about this case the only reason
(2:59:49) they said that was so all of the poor little people in the back of the room didn't get the idea that they could get
(2:59:55) up there and do the same thing this little gal did they're not gonna call her back because they got no jurisdiction they're not going to try that case because she's gonna blow their
(3:00:00) doors up okay now that's one of the most beautiful
(3:00:07) texts and the fastest and one the last time I did it it was before a
(3:00:13) particularly obnoxious judge and he basically said to me how many
(3:00:18) times have you pulled this and I said no you're honored this would be I think this is the 12th time
(3:00:23) he said ah go on for Lucky 13 eh
(3:00:30) he said this is very clever he says but I'm gonna give you some advice young man don't ever get caught doing nothing in
(3:00:37) my town got me sir I never did any trying to be a regular gentleman
(3:00:43) simply you better not get caught doing nothing because I will Hammer your tail and I said does that mean the case is
(3:00:50) dismissed your honor he says it's dismissed you're out of here now I'm telling you this works and it
(3:00:56) works real good now the next effective step that you can do is you can turn around and ask the judge if he's a licensed attorney to practice law
(3:01:02) because none of the judges are licensed take my word for it Michigan Constitution says that they are required
(3:01:07) to be licensed by the state of Michigan the state of Michigan does not license attorneys the bar association licenses them they give him a p number and a card
(3:01:14) that says yeah you're a member of the bar association but if you call up the bar association they will tell you they don't give nobody a license the state of
(3:01:22) Michigan doesn't give them a license the buyer Association didn't give a license so what license could they be talking about
(3:01:30) Mickey Mouse license because that's the only one that's left
(3:01:35) the state does an issue in the mayor doesn't issue one and the one they got hanging on the wall does not a license from the state of Michigan and the
(3:01:42) Constitution the state of Michigan says all judges will be licensed to practice law before the state
(3:01:47) you ask them where is the guy's license he doesn't have one and your enemy I please record it since
(3:01:54) you don't have a license I'm asking you to recuse yourself until we can get a judge that has a license now a little lady
(3:01:59) name of Virginia craps he's the one that perfected this argument she's a genius at it she's a little Spitfire if you
(3:02:04) ever watch her in court you're actually going to see a treat because she is something else she's got character she graduated a full
(3:02:12) attorney from Wayne State University and then she refused to join the bar because she didn't want to compromise
(3:02:18) her rights with their political chicanery and she she is a full-fledged serious
(3:02:26) business legal person and to hear her working court is absolutely like listening to stradivari
(3:02:32) work the violin she walks in and blows her doors up while she's on about three judges now
(3:02:37) for the same thing she blew the first judge out so then they sent in another judge they moved her over to the other side of town over and over in Berkeley
(3:02:44) Michigan and then she walked in and she blew that judge out of the door so then they sent her to another judge and then she turned around and went before the
(3:02:51) state the licensing commission and now they've handed it up to the to the judicial
(3:02:57) people of the state to try and resolve the problem they're going to end up dropping it the judge doesn't have a license no it's supposed to judge could
(3:03:03) prove he has a license which he doesn't judge let me ask you a question under your retirement fund isn't it a fact
(3:03:10) that you get a certain percentage of the rake off of all the tickets that come before your bench
(3:03:15) well yeah and isn't out of a forty dollars that comes across your bench you get 18.75
(3:03:22) oh yeah so you have a financial interest in this matter isn't that correct well yeah wasn't it a violation of
(3:03:29) judicial candidate number seven you're not supposed to have any financial interest in any marriage comes before your court
(3:03:37) I'm going to ask you to recluse yourself for bias for an intermediate please of course and every single judge
(3:03:43) has got it now does everybody understand how many ways you can Hammer them just out of the shoot without even getting nasty
(3:03:50) the judge don't have a license the judge has got a personal interest in the case for financial reasons
(3:03:56) there is no jurisdiction here in the year that made a secret once jurisdiction the burden falls on the
(3:04:02) plaintiff to prove jurisdiction see and he can't do it it cannot be done there isn't any
(3:04:07) there is no jurisdiction to hear a traffic ticket in the United States of America I know all yours didn't make oh
(3:04:12) come on they've been getting this for years a traffic ticket is a writ of assistance
(3:04:18) or a bill of attainer you look in your Constitution you'll find out bills of the teenager are against the
(3:04:23) Constitution and it's stated at least twice that I
(3:04:28) know all right I'm telling you you read your Constitution there is no place for a traffic ticket you cannot have a writ
(3:04:36) of assistance that has civil Equity arguments that transmit into
(3:04:43) law penalties they can't throw you in jail for a debt
(3:04:49) because that's a debtor's prison we have a constitutional argument against that also
(3:04:55) how do they do it cause they wants to and because you don't know any better that's how they do it
(3:05:01) what if they have a card if they say it's a court of equity all right that's a good question very um
(3:05:07) I'm glad you're paying attention here if they say they have a court of equity and there is equity then you turn to them
(3:05:12) and say thank you your honor I appreciate your time I would like to know who is the injured party and where
(3:05:18) the contract is can you show me the contract there is no contract unless you didn't
(3:05:24) sign your license on UD 1-207 without prejudice
(3:05:29) where is the contract it's when you sign for that license so don't sign for that license unless
(3:05:35) you put UD 1-207 without prejudice UCC one dash 207 now it
(3:05:44) is your waiver into the contract not to give up your constitutional rights to travel freely unencumbered right and let me ask you this can you enter
(3:05:51) into an unconstitutional contract that lawfully the contract is voidable for not lawful performance it has to be
(3:05:58) a lawful contract all right now the next thing who's the injured party who got injured show me
(3:06:03) judge the parking meter out there another neat trick that I like to do
(3:06:09) especially in speeding tickets is I like to confront my accuser I always like to call a black box that accused me of
(3:06:14) speeding to the stand and the judge always gets upset and I tell them all your honor I said
(3:06:20) I've been asking this policeman here for three hours how does the black box that he's been playing with worse and he can't tell me and we've been through the
(3:06:26) whole stationary Mobile radar manual from Macomb County Community College Law Enforcement Academy and I've asked him
(3:06:31) every question and I don't know how he passed the second class radio operator's license because he doesn't know how the damn thing works period he doesn't even
(3:06:37) know how to set up the test to properly test the thing in all environments I said on top of that I said he is not the
(3:06:43) witness he is nothing but a hearsay witness and his testimony is inadmissible in any court in the land because you can't have here say he says
(3:06:49) what the hell are you talking about I said he did not truly accuse me that black box with
(3:06:55) flashing lights on it little beepers accuse me I said now if I had a black box in here with little lights on and
(3:07:00) making noises and accusing and saying I didn't speed he didn't speed he didn't speed we know how far that'd go right
(3:07:06) through their window judge you throw it right out through that window but you let this guy bring his idiot box in with flashing lights and be presenter and his
(3:07:12) thing is exactly by the book in an admissible in court he he can't tell me how the thing works we've been trying
(3:07:18) for three and a half hours to test him to see if he knows how it worked he couldn't pass that test to save his life
(3:07:23) and the bottom line is I still don't think the damn thing works and personally I want to call it to the
(3:07:28) stand and confront my accuser and erratic one section 13 paragraph five I gotta write to confront my accuser and I'd like to confront my accuser and I'm
(3:07:34) serving a subpoena a subpoena Deuces take him which means bring your books and Records
(3:07:39) too he goes That's pretty clever I says not only that your honor he's arguing apples
(3:07:46) and oranges see I got a speedometer in my car and it might be plus or minus 12 miles an hour on a factory made one a
(3:07:51) handmade one is plus or minus six miles an hour I said and mine's got a little needle on it it works off a little cable
(3:07:57) that goes in the transmission it runs off a little gear I says it doesn't have four decimal places and it doesn't do space logic and all this other stuff and
(3:08:04) shoot out a mile ahead and tell me how fast the telephone poles are flying by
(3:08:09) I said he's got this handy day Danny Gadget in his car that's measuring speed one way and I got this one that's measuring speed my way
(3:08:15) so how could I be guilty to the extent that his is talking about because I don't have one of them in my car
(3:08:21) you see the apples and the oranges here judge it's not really a fair test is it he goes
(3:08:26) that's a pretty good argument you got there he says I'll tell you what we're gonna do you've crossed my card enough for the
(3:08:33) day I'm going to dismiss the case what do you think of that it's fine by me you're on
(3:08:39) but before we do I have one more bit Sharon he says what's that I said you see that police officer here I have
(3:08:46) a great deal respect for that police officer and I don't like to see that police officer get injured in any capacity I personally feel that police
(3:08:53) officer sitting in that vehicle all day for eight hours a day getting bombarded by high energy microwave energy is an
(3:08:59) insult to that police officer's life to his family I personally feel for that police officer I wonder why these guys
(3:09:05) are so irritable and why they don't want to eat no food and they don't want to jump the old lady when they go home and I says I understand why it's because they're being bombarded by this high
(3:09:12) energy microwave and I said some of them are getting cancer I says I think that if this is an atrocity and I said I
(3:09:18) don't think required to Sydney to sit in her all day
(3:09:23) all day which could cause him to get testicular cancer and all kind of other problems with his life and and just so
(3:09:29) that the city can make bucks off of these tickets I possesses this is an atrocity you don't worry about that
(3:09:35) please man that's my job I worry about that please sir if I said I worry about him he works for me I worry about him
(3:09:42) and I says no I personally run tests on this thing or we took a microwave leak detector right from Radio Shack which
(3:09:48) used to detect the microwave leaks on your radar range at home and I said we went over by the radar car he flipped the switch out and that thing
(3:09:54) went in the red so I know them guys you're being bombarded by high energy microwave energy and I know that if I had a microwave energy oven at home that
(3:10:01) was leaking that man I'd go in the trash you understand because of the dangerous
(3:10:07) hazardous energy that is being given off by the thing I says now you asked my police officer
(3:10:12) here my my friend in in in in the in the community that's going to protect me to put a risk of cancer or something like
(3:10:19) that on his body I said I think that's absolutely Un-American and I'm Protestant
(3:10:26) he said well I'll take it under consideration I said and I thank you for your concern for our police officers so that's all
(3:10:33) right your honors trying to be a good citizen so we walked out of the courtroom that cop came alongside of me and he says I
(3:10:39) ain't never turning that damn thing on again everywhere now that cyclone
(3:10:46) that's how it works and I was right and I was honestly trying to help him but he told me he ain't never turning that damn
(3:10:52) thing on again foreign about 1985. now they've been publishing
(3:10:59) in the news just in the last year you're hearing about all these cops that are coming up with cancer from all kind of various things well this is why folks
(3:11:05) because they're being bombarded by these high energy radar guns if I was a policeman I wouldn't turn that thing on for nothing I'd cut the wire or anything
(3:11:12) I'm not turning it on what do you think of that all right take it out looking at a speedometer and I'll see how fast the guy is going if he's going fast I'll
(3:11:18) give him a ticket but I'm not turning that thing up just so I can have my hair fall out get a get
(3:11:24) a chemotherapy treatment I don't need that kind of stuff you understand
(3:11:30) I told the judge I says you've got any kind of idea what kind of power is coming off the end of the antenna on that gun I said for every inch that it
(3:11:37) goes past the windshield the power curve is squaring itself now it's reaching out
(3:11:42) a quarter of a mile you got any kind of idea how much power is coming off the end of that antenna
(3:11:47) I said that poor guy is being bombarded with high energy microwave energy I don't think it's right
(3:11:54) so anyway it got dismissed in uh psychological warfare worked in most of the cops in my area don't even have that
(3:12:00) thing on anymore because I notice when you go by in my radar detector doesn't even go off so I know that it's effective now that's psychological
(3:12:06) warfare It's a combination of honesty and basically I do care about the police officers I don't want them to be
(3:12:12) endangered they're good police officers out there they have a right to work and have a safe job just like anybody else
(3:12:17) anymore and I was upset with them when they dumped agent orange on us when we were in Vietnam I mean it's so logical okay now the
(3:12:25) bottom line is a lot of things are going on out here and you have to be cognizant of what's going on and you have to be
(3:12:30) cognizant of your rights and you have to be willing to take the necessary and appropriate action then you can have
(3:12:36) some fun at it I I like uh an elder gentleman who's one of my
(3:12:42) mentors used to small and he says uh if you're not having fun you're not doing
(3:12:48) it right he says I'll submit a brief and then he'll send it back to me and he'll tell me all the things that are wrong with it
(3:12:54) and I'll fix it and I'll send it right back to him and I'll add a few more things in there and he'll get all mad that I fixed it and then I'll then he'll
(3:13:00) send me back a thing telling me he doesn't agree with it and I'll send him back an answer telling me that's too bad because that's the law
(3:13:08) now you can have a lot of fun doing this another neat thing you can do is go down and sit in courts I highly recommend
(3:13:14) ladies or gentlemen that don't have anything to do for an afternoon retirees especially get your Best gal or your
(3:13:19) best to uh girlfriend or boyfriend whatever it is take two of you two safety and
(3:13:25) numbers take two of you dress in your best suit and what have you tie or best of the skirt and one hand you go down and sit
(3:13:32) in court and take a legal pad is tulian set there for the day and the left you want to sit in the left rear side the
(3:13:37) last few in the left rear side and just sit there and do not smile
(3:13:43) they'll think you're from the judicial tenure Commission you ought to see what happens it's great
(3:13:49) everybody gets read their rights everybody gets treated like a human creature it's absolutely uh
(3:13:58) the judge will stop what he's doing and ask you we're not here for anything serious today are we and I'll say no sir
(3:14:04) you're right I'm just casually observing [Music]
(3:14:09) why are we here today all right sir we were just in the area we heard that you were a real good judge
(3:14:15) and we wanted to see you in action my associate was driving in the area and we stopped by to see him he says that fish
(3:14:21) smells awful Loosely wrapped to me now you tell me why you're here right
(3:14:27) now honest to God sir we're just casually observing okay all lawyers in my Chambers shut the court down goes in
(3:14:33) his Chambers now look they start trying cases in the chambers and they started trying them in
(3:14:39) the hallway and they were in around the side of the clerk's office at the other in the hallway then they come back and then the little gal from the prosecutor
(3:14:45) goes on she says what's with the Nerd Patrol the judge give her a look that would kill
(3:14:51) don't you do it today honey you keep that mouth zipped these guys
(3:14:56) are from the tenure Commission we don't want no problems with the state you
(3:15:02) button that hitch I mean you can have a lot of fun my
(3:15:07) associate was just absolutely almost in tears he could keep her stay faced in the water so I said sorry we're leaving
(3:15:13) we got out all the way down Rochester Road to the
(3:15:19) expressway so that's the most fun I had in my life just sitting there in that day and
(3:15:24) everybody was getting off guys were getting sentences canceled guys are getting out of jail one guy at twenty five hundred dollars
(3:15:31) with the fines and they got reduced to 120 24 and five days serve
(3:15:36) it was 240 dollars and it was going to be 10 days in jail but the judge turned to me and when kisses I can't throw them
(3:15:41) in jail for a civil interaction doing that
(3:15:46) so this is the last offer I'm going to give young man it's going to be 124 and five day serves that sound good to you
(3:15:53) the lawyer turns to me says you better take this is the best deal you're ever gonna get
(3:15:58) so I'm telling you you can be effective as Citizens you sound off tell them hey this man
(3:16:04) I heard we got American flag on a pole out there last time I heard we got a constitution and by God we're going to keep it
(3:16:10) forever forever anybody got a problem with that okay now there's a bunch of other things
(3:16:16) we're going to take just a little break here and we're going to come back and we're going to finish off with some really hard stuff for the advanced
(3:16:21) student I always take all my lucky charms with me and I was one of the fellas that served with the infamous
(3:16:27) Apache troop first squad or ninth year cavalry uh we were the fellas that were in the
(3:16:33) movie Apocalypse Now where they told you I love the smell of napalm in the morning and that gentleman was exactly
(3:16:39) was exactly like that huh this book is done about the
(3:16:47) Cobra Gunship pilot by the name of Jerome Boyle who we used to call uh beardy Harry because he looked just like
(3:16:54) uh Dirty Harry make my day he used to have that painted
(3:17:00) on the side of his aircraft along with Pinball Wizard and a few other things uh
(3:17:05) this is a phenomenal book about a story of uh serious Americans This is a cobra
(3:17:11) pilot Jerry Boyle's Own Story a former policeman arrived in Vietnam in March of 70 he went from being a FNG which I
(3:17:18) can't tell you what that is in a church but it's bad to a combat vet in just two months whether rescuing down Crews
(3:17:24) flying fiery combat missions during the invasion of Cambodia being shot down himself while saw War quickly turned
(3:17:29) from a scary game of bullets rockets and grenades to a terrifying race against death we're just split seconds could
(3:17:36) turn a scene of breathtaking Beauty into one of Stark absolute Terror he witnessed men risked their lives daily
(3:17:42) to save others and he heard the dreaded call taking fire taking fire that were too often a fellow Pilot's
(3:17:49) very last words before his chapter became an inferno well I learned real fast that there weren't a lot of going
(3:17:54) home parties for Apache troops Pilots and when you listen to some of the stuff
(3:18:00) this is a cobra Pilot's life and death experiences in Vietnam's legendary Apache troop first of the ninth air
(3:18:06) cavalry this pilot is the recipient of uh he was a California Native and former police
(3:18:12) interventor of California among the medals and decorations awarded aim for his service and this was kind of typical of most of the people in this outfit
(3:18:20) Silver Star three distinguished flying crosses five round Stars two Army Commendation metal surveiller he now
(3:18:26) works as a pilot who flies in the sport of offshore operations he lives in Andrea he lives in Ohio California with
(3:18:33) his wife Andrea of 20 years and to read some of the stuff about this is absolutely
(3:18:39) phenomenal some of the things that get involved I'll just read you the a closing part of this thing
(3:18:48) to give you an idea the Apache troop I served in wasn't part
(3:18:54) of the army the Army was part of Apache troop we were Mavericks but the kind of team that any commander with hair on his
(3:19:01) tailpipe would want his unit to be late if you couldn't get what you needed to
(3:19:06) accomplish the mission through normal channels we big borrowed or stole it usually the ladder
(3:19:11) with few exceptions I'd follow the men of Apache troop into hell no one full well sooner or later someone from the
(3:19:18) blues the whites the Reds to lift the tune of the Miss section would emerge from a smoking hole dragging a dead
(3:19:23) smoldering ass of the devil hydrates a little bit but I can tell you
(3:19:29) that these men were phenomenal phenomenal Fighters and it was my great privilege
(3:19:34) to serve with them and when I go to court I take oh of my battle stuff my my Ranger stuff my
(3:19:41) first year cab this is from the Apache troop logo there's my flight Wing the extra ones I wore this is the first of
(3:19:48) the ninth logo that was put on the nose of all the aircraft there's the first there's first 75th

(3:20:20) put that on there I take my strike like lightning sound like thunder
(3:20:26) all my Ranger stuff that when I was in the Rangers and I take my first year Cavalry when I
(3:20:33) was in Cambodia because I was with these boys on Cambodian locked in my Apache troop
(3:20:40) that's right off of our shoulder Patches from the Apache troop the original one I was with the take my Detroit Judo Club
(3:20:48) this is a patch they give you if you're running 50 miles to save your life you've got a certain time to do it in they give you a boot lace and a pocket
(3:20:55) knife and if you get caught they put you in A POW Camp and treat you like a prisoner so it's like you got 12 hours to run 50
(3:21:02) miles or you go to the pow compound and they treat you like uh
(3:21:08) a pow they hung my buddy up in a pit full of poisonous snakes upside down for about a day or two
(3:21:15) and then this is my other patches that I wear from from Vietnam and
(3:21:21) Special Operations group I flew in support of Vogue rights and Cambodia we used to deliver their supplies I got my
(3:21:27) my Ranger belt buckle all these are momentos of it program my bronze star medal my I have
(3:21:34) 33 of these air Metals I got five of these Brown Stars I got a distinguished flying cross Vietnamese cross the
(3:21:39) gallantry 33 year metals shot down four times left for dead twice walked out of Cambodia with two regiments on my tail
(3:21:46) feathers this is the sog Special Operations group macv that we flew in support of uh
(3:21:54) Vogue rights and Cambodia and the Cambodian operation I was one of the special air Crews that was selected
(3:22:00) personally to fly the infamous marine sniper and allow us to shoot that General at 800
(3:22:06) yards I was one of the guys that flew him in and we wear the wings of eagles
(3:22:14) we support the National Rifle Association totally
(3:22:19) you know we ain't fooling around we want our constitution we want our Second Amendment I am a member of Vietnam
(3:22:24) veterans and basically when I go to court I put all my Lucky Charms in my pocket it kind
(3:22:31) of drives them nuts down at the courthouse I also have my flag I always take my flag with me
(3:22:38) and I have my Vietnam veterans belt buckles and my uh the oppresso Libre which means the
(3:22:45) Liberator of an oppression from the special forces that was given to me by the boys over there and for
(3:22:52) helping them you know so all this goes in my my pockets and I
(3:22:58) go to court my lucky charm I call them and it it's a little heavy but I you
(3:23:06) know it's like when I go I go for memory of those fine soldiers and some of the things they add
(3:23:12) rather be killing communists one of the models of the paratroopers from the charity company Ranger company
(3:23:19) Rangers was the boys that supported that parachute that uh that marine sniper that shot him with
(3:23:25) shot that General at 800 yards so I'm a soldier soldier I've been a soldier soldier I believe in the things
(3:23:31) that the soldiers have done I've seen a lot of good soldiers pay the maximum price
(3:23:37) um I personally killed him in my arms and I listened to their last words tell my mother tell my wife tell my family I
(3:23:44) love them and to me the Constitution is a very serious factor and we defend it
(3:23:53) to the death and do not fool around when it comes to the Constitution I've been doing it for 25 years I am a graduate of
(3:24:00) Project Blue Book the special project
(3:24:06) I also take my harmonica I am harmonica Project Blue Book is where they pull
(3:24:13) their soldiers aside and taught you the Constitution and I always take my harmonic and I give
(3:24:18) them hell
(3:24:30) we give it to him
(3:24:36) yeah well we uh we were flying interdiction along the Cambodian border
(3:24:42) and we come up on the door these uh b-model Huey it was a smaller Huey and
(3:24:47) it was uh painted blue and silver and uh all along the side of the tail
(3:24:54) boom was white uh powder no I informed the aircraft commander and he told me
(3:25:01) he was healing them on the hailing frequency and he called him up and told them the land we wanted to inspect their cargo and they told us basically to
(3:25:08) blank off and die you know who we are my pilot told him he didn't care if he
(3:25:13) was a man from glad he was going to land an aircraft we were going to inspect this cargo basically he told us uh
(3:25:22) we're not Landing my pilot ordered me to roll my guns up and he shot him down we went down there and we blew his landing
(3:25:29) gear off shot it below his fuel cell and he got the idea we weren't fooling around he went down and landed in the
(3:25:35) rice paddy and we inspected his cargo and sure enough he was carrying heroin so the pilot gave him a choice he could
(3:25:41) go to Long been jail with us for Contraband trafficking or he could uh hitchhike home baby
(3:25:47) so he chose the hitchhike home and figured he had a chance of course we knew that was going to be rather
(3:25:53) difficult in Cambodia him being three foot tall or anything they were walking and a white man on top of that
(3:25:59) but uh we gave him a chance and the bottom line is he didn't want to go to jail so
(3:26:05) we torched his aircraft and uh we got back in the CEO uh are you crazy and
(3:26:12) those people are CIA they're gonna kill you I told him make my day I said uh
(3:26:17) they were trafficking in that dope to rgis and uh God knows who else and as far as I'm concerned we stuck a tomb for
(3:26:23) about 15 million and I'm just tickling if I could do it again tomorrow I'd do it again
(3:26:28) and that's a true story we actually did it so anyway to make a long story short I'm a
(3:26:34) serious Soldier I love my country and its Constitution and I do not compromise when it comes to Constitution
(3:26:40) I descend to the death that's what we do anybody who knows about great sees the most decorated soldier in the history of
(3:26:47) the United States he's a very congenial gentleman he uh when we worked for them in
(3:26:52) Cambodia he was all business all business and uh we flew his fifth Special Forces people all over for
(3:26:59) whatever Recon missions they had and um they they got to work with us and
(3:27:05) they know we were pretty serious folks and uh I personally think uh Bob writes is going to be painted as some Desperado
(3:27:12) no matter what he does only because he is uh is uh associated with the avant-garde
(3:27:18) type uh constitutional defense he was the guy that got the Ruby uh
(3:27:25) Ridge Manor resolved peacefully um clearly he went in to save Randy Weaver
(3:27:33) because Randy Weaver used to be one of his boys on the team
(3:27:39) asked in his own life because it goes to him too so he's a man of great courage I respect
(3:27:46) uh what he's doing I appreciate that he's trying to make things happen but I also
(3:27:51) know that he's going to be held in some type of villainous to no matter what he does people are going to not understand
(3:27:57) and they're going to be afraid and of course the newspapers will continue to paint him as uh whatever Boogeyman in
(3:28:02) the closet they can all right we're gonna go on with our programming here we just got a little
(3:28:08) off the track there just a little bit just to kind of let you give an idea where we're coming from actually uh we take a pretty serious
(3:28:16) attack on the Constitution and we want to get into some other issues we want to
(3:28:21) get into uh things like things like money money money money money money money and one of the best
(3:28:28) tips you can get it's from a gentleman uh we call him
(3:28:33) Ernie uh he uh basically is known throughout the
(3:28:38) movement around here he delivers all the tapes and what have you and he has a tape called
(3:28:45) wake up America and basically it starts telling you how money works and why it works and what
(3:28:52) they're doing with our money and when you're done
(3:28:57) you really understand what's going on but we want to share some things with you about the money we got a good story
(3:29:02) to tell you too but basically we want to share with you right now in Michigan the Michigan
(3:29:08) compile laws 21.153 Michigan compile laws act
(3:29:13) obligations do state or municipality and date operative when paid by check or
(3:29:18) legal tender whenever any check or Bank draft shall be tendered for the payment of any debt
(3:29:24) taxes or other obligation do the state or to any municipality they're in such
(3:29:31) check draft shall operate as a payment made on the date the check or draft was
(3:29:37) received and accepted by the receiving officer if it shall be paid on the presentation without deduction for
(3:29:44) exchange or cost of collection all agencies of the state of Michigan shall request that checks tendered in
(3:29:51) payment of an obligation due the state shall be made payable to
(3:29:56) the state of Michigan no receiving officer shall be required to receive in
(3:30:01) payment of any debt taxes or other obligation collectible or receivable by him any tender
(3:30:08) other than gold or silver coin of the United States the United States Treasury notes which you can't get today
(3:30:14) gold certificates which you can't get today's silver certificates which you can't get today or other Federal Reserve
(3:30:20) Bank notes and there's no banknotes in circulation there's Federal Reserve notes but there's no federal reserve banknotes
(3:30:26) now the reality is by this fact you are specifically precluded from tendering
(3:30:32) lawfully without being a party to a felony that of the basement of the coin of the realm against the 1792 coinage
(3:30:37) act the Sherman coinage egg so Roger Sherman wrote a book about this and
(3:30:43) it tells you all about coinage in the debasement of the coin of the realm and that's why he is affiliated with the
(3:30:48) 1792 coinage act now the reality to this is what has been going on over a period of
(3:30:54) time is they've been playing games with the money as we can see right here
(3:30:59) we have right here a silver certificate this certifies that there is on deposit
(3:31:04) in the treasury of the United States one dollar right of silver all right
(3:31:11) one dollar in silver payable to the bearer on demand now we had a little
(3:31:17) time we got together we had some of these notes we had some gold certificate notes also we got one here that says uh
(3:31:25) [Music] we got one here that says uh United States note the United States of America
(3:31:31) now notice the difference here folks this one just says this node is legal
(3:31:36) tender for all debts public and private but we know that that's a lie because Article 1 Section 10 of the Constitution
(3:31:41) says nothing but gold and silver coins shall be made a tender in payment of debt now this is going to bring up a real
(3:31:48) interesting case that we got here now we went down to the Federal Reserve Bank and we took 500 worth of uh these
(3:31:56) are silver certificates here but we took gold certificates 20 gold pieces we had five hundred dollars Rick and we went in
(3:32:02) this Federal Reserve Bank and I walked up to the window and I said I'm the bearer on demand and lawful money of
(3:32:07) accounting the United States Government Center I said I said I want my gold I handed her the notes she looked at me
(3:32:13) and she said sir we don't have any gold I said are you trying to tell me this bank is overextended everybody looks you can't come in here
(3:32:21) and do that sir you're gonna get a run out of band guys some I'm asking you for my gold I'm the bearer I'm hearing
(3:32:27) before you demanding it says painted the barrier on demanding off money in the county United States government 20 is
(3:32:32) gold I got 500 worth of these and I'll take 20 gold pieces we don't have any gold
(3:32:39) are you trying to tell me this bank is overextended
(3:32:45) this Lieutenant comes running up and all these guys got rifles in here all the poor arms
(3:32:50) then the lieutenant walks up to me says all right what the hell is going on here so I explained to him I said sir I am
(3:32:55) the bearer on demand and lawful money of the county United States government I'm here and before this bank this is a
(3:33:00) waffle Bank of the government and I'm asking you I'm asking them to pay me the
(3:33:06) bear on demand my twenty dollars in gold for every one of these 20 gold demand deposit the notes that I have and I have
(3:33:13) up to 500 worth and I just asked you for the gold she told me she doesn't have any gold I tried to tell her you tell me the Spanx over extended she told me you
(3:33:19) can't come in here and do that and the next thing you know you show up the lieutenant looked at me so once you
(3:33:24) get the guys gold come on guys we're out of here so they
(3:33:30) left they couldn't give me my gold because
(3:33:36) they ain't got any gold but there is a contract on here that says pay to the bear on demand
(3:33:42) now on this one it's a dollar silver in theory the contract is there and you could in
(3:33:48) theory go collect it but if I'm trying to collect it there is no gold there is no silver they
(3:33:54) don't have any now over a period a long period of time in barter we have slowly
(3:33:59) been pushed into a position of of impossibility to perform
(3:34:05) now if you walk in and check your hat and
(3:34:11) get a hat check and then when you come back to get your hat back
(3:34:16) they hand you another hand check can you wear the hat check obviously not so obviously the note
(3:34:24) is not the dollar all it is is the promise to pay a dollar
(3:34:30) does everybody understand that and what has happened over a long period of time in customer uses is the people have been
(3:34:35) hoodwinked into thinking that they have money dollars there are no dollars dollars you need a measurement
(3:34:42) which brings up a very famous case the case of Montgomery Wards versus Eugene glacier
(3:34:48) for those of you who want to order the case we'll be happy to give you the court case numbers let me take this off so it doesn't
(3:34:54) reflect too much this is a very famous case okay
(3:34:59) the docket number is 82-002087 this is before The Honorable
(3:35:06) District Court of 52nd 3rd District Court the judge of the record was the
(3:35:11) honorable James P Sheehy okay so now I'll give you a little synopsis
(3:35:17) of this case what happened in this case did everybody get the court number first
(3:35:22) though eight two dash zero zero two zero eight seven all right now
(3:35:28) what happened in this case to make a long story short gentleman's wife got a little mad at him
(3:35:34) decided to take his credit card and go out and charge to Montgomery Wards from the front door to the back door and he ran up quite a large sum debt
(3:35:40) the matter got of course Montgomery Wards well I'm gonna take it back you bought it to church you got it now and
(3:35:46) they went to court and uh came up for the the famous judge James P Sheehy a
(3:35:53) 52nd Third District Court who by the way is a very excellent judge very knowledgeable very very
(3:35:58) a decent man a kindly man at least pretty serious physical so if you're screwing around he's going to hammer you
(3:36:03) but most of the time he's quite congenial and kind of a lot of fun too
(3:36:08) but it came up before his court and up jumped the devil in the deep blue sea and they're starting to argue and the judge saying well let me ask you a
(3:36:14) question he says did you get a credit card he said yeah so you signed for the credit card he said yeah
(3:36:20) so you get a credit card to your wife he said yeah he said here's the bill you pay he says okay judge now let me explain
(3:36:27) something to you you told me that the judgment is for this amount is
(3:36:32) that right and I'm asking you and you told me it's this many dollars and I'm asking you for a determination of the
(3:36:38) dollars what what dollars sure you can interpret it any way you want you can make it frankincense or
(3:36:44) murder I don't care I don't care if you don't even pay his judgment I'll tell you what don't pay it there's a lot of documents in the
(3:36:50) basement they never pay them so don't pay it we'll just take judgment against you and we'll attach it you know
(3:36:56) whatever we need for bits of attachment and what we're going to collect on this debt sir you misunderstood you just
(3:37:02) understood point now you you have told me uh this amount of dollars
(3:37:09) and and I'm I'm confused here I need to know something about these dollars he says well he said let me clarify it for
(3:37:15) you I've entered a judgment against you for the amount due all right he said yes sir but if I ask you for a pound of
(3:37:22) something you're going to say a pound of what and if I ask you for a gallon of something you're gonna say a gallon of what and if I ask you for a foot or a
(3:37:27) yard or something you're gonna say a foot or a yard or what now you're coming to me and telling me dollars and I'm asking you dollars of what because
(3:37:33) dollar is a unit of measurement he said you can make it anything you want tell you what make a coffee beans
(3:37:39) now at that instant the Montgomery Wards attorney came to a half rise and he went
(3:37:45) your honor all right there was 40 of us Plus in the court we
(3:37:50) sat here and all we could do was go because we realized instantly what this judge had just did he had made a
(3:37:56) determination of the substance of the money account of the United States government pursuant to Coffee Beans
(3:38:03) with great Courage the honorable Judge James PC had made a determination if the substance of the money of account in the
(3:38:08) United States government was coffee beans that's what we told the Wall Street Journal and all the newspapers and television stations that would
(3:38:13) listen he was most upset about that
(3:38:19) instantly the judge looked across the room we're all sitting with our jaw on the ground
(3:38:26) and he'll lean back in his chair flipped his pencil in the air and he said ah s with a hit on the record
(3:38:34) he realized that a landmark Michigan court decision had occurred he realized that Montgomery Wards wasn't going to
(3:38:40) say nothing because they won they ain't gonna appeal they won they were they gonna appeal you won you won you won you won it's nothing
(3:38:47) to appeal we weren't gonna appeal because we won two we got the judge to make a determination of the substance of
(3:38:52) the money become the United States government was coffee beans you can see in the back of this book here
(3:38:58) Mr Glacier took the Judgment right here and this was for 1098.97 he did it in 100 bean bags
(3:39:05) certified one bean to the dollar and 97 100 so we cut the tip of the bean
(3:39:10) off painted a white line on it he sent it to Montgomery Wards you got it on there
(3:39:16) please find and close in this package 1100
(3:39:21) and 48 coffee beans which is payment in full pursuant to judge of the 52nd
(3:39:26) District Court October 8 1982 before his honorable Judge James PC I think his served your time travel concerning this
(3:39:33) matter most graciously yours truly certified mail sent to him they never
(3:39:38) said nothing nor would they nor could they he honored the stipulation of the judge
(3:39:44) okay now to this date this gentleman comes to court with a big red bag marble bag
(3:39:51) full of coffee beans and he's got stenciled on the side jeans beans
(3:39:56) I read you the last statement this is kind of hilarious you it's pretty good
(3:40:03) he's asking for determination of the substance of the money of account I read you about the last three pages
(3:40:10) she goes all right therefore really out of his own
(3:40:15) testimony it seems to me that judgment really is unavoidable in that amount thank you you're out of the Court anything else sir you have the right to
(3:40:22) a closing argument Mr Glacier only that I don't think I received a fair and incredible trial here today to court
(3:40:27) this is a closing argument regarding this trial okay as to the subject matter Mr Glacier subject matter I have nothing
(3:40:33) to add to the subject matter here at the court the court makes the following finding effects that the court finds are pursuant to plants exhibit number one
(3:40:39) and Mr Glacier Eugene Glacier entered into a contract with Montgomery Wards and a company which it is a monthly account
(3:40:45) two pursuant to plans exhibit number two that the account was used by probably 95
(3:40:50) 99 of the time of the purchases by his wife while they were married number three that for Testimony of Mr Davis is
(3:40:57) under about a testimony Mr Davis in the balance owing on the account is 1098.97
(3:41:02) and the court also finds that Mr Grossman Mr Grossman's excuse me from Mr
(3:41:09) glacier's testimony that he just recently got divorced actually August 24 1981 and that divorce proceeding he
(3:41:16) accepted the liability too on this account as between he and his wife based upon the information the court makes a conclusion of law that Mr Eugene glacier
(3:41:22) to kind of this matter owes Montgomery award 1988.97 Court finds a judgment of favor
(3:41:29) plaintiff and the amount of plus costs Mr Glacier you have a right to appeal us and that appeal I think is in 15 or 20
(3:41:35) days Mr gross Mr girls from 20 years under 21 actually out of County 23. I think it's 20 all over now you're under
(3:41:42) the court I think it is it used to be 15 in some cases and 20 on others and I could never keep it straight but I think
(3:41:48) it's 20. you have a right to appeal in 20 days if you appeal let me explain to you how you do that you have the file
(3:41:54) with the court the circuit claim of appeal are those the ones that are marked by the way those exhibits Mr
(3:42:00) Grossman oh yes sir Uranus that's right the court we better keep those you can give him a
(3:42:08) copy of the other one spider but away you you can file a claim of appeal with a circuit court in this court you also
(3:42:14) make a request to the court scenario for copy of the record a copy the record must file within a certain amount of time then you can tell you you must file
(3:42:21) as I say a claim of appeal and then you have a certain number of days after that to file your bill okay claim of the
(3:42:26) field is nothing more than a little form I hear by Clan field okay so but some but the court clerks can give you more
(3:42:32) information but if you don't file an appeal within 20 days you've lost your right for an appeal any other questions
(3:42:38) before the court recesses I'd still like to have a motion for a more definite statement dollars of what am I do I own
(3:42:44) accord dollars of what the court the court has made it now this is this is after he had already told him dollars of
(3:42:49) what before and the judge told him frankincense and myrrh
(3:42:55) and then he kept hammering away at this Dallas or what and the court lost at school the court has made a judgment of
(3:43:01) 1098.97 and however you interpret that sir if you want that and coffee beans that's okay with me really
(3:43:08) okay thank you much and at that point we all went oh
(3:43:14) and he went oh s with a hit he realized he threw his pencil up in here
(3:43:19) now this is a magnificent case in an example and to this day this gentleman still pays Court judgments with coffee
(3:43:26) beans and if the viable case you can use the case as a reference uh it's a landmark Michigan court decision
(3:43:31) we use it thoroughly okay now to make a long story short
(3:43:38) Article 1 Section 10 of the Constitution is clear and specific says nothing but gold and silver coin
(3:43:45) shall be made a tender in payment of debt we got article in section 10 right here
(3:43:51) for those of you who are looking for no bill of attainder or exposed fact the law shall be passed that's traffic
(3:43:58) tickets folks a bill of attainder is a traffic ticket can you see that right here
(3:44:03) no bill of attainder or exclus facto law shall be passed no capitation or other
(3:44:08) Direct Tax shall be laid unless by the rule of apportionment or census D we'll we'll talk about that later that's another heavy one
(3:44:15) all right but Article 1 Section 10
(3:44:21) particularly no State shall make anything but gold and silver coin a tender and payment of debt
(3:44:26) debt all right here we go here we go right here no State Should enter into any treaty
(3:44:32) Alliance or Confederation Grant letters of Mark and reprisal
(3:44:38) the letter of Mark a reprisal was like your brothers messed with the king so the king is
(3:44:44) going to attack your family and put a letter of Mark out on them
(3:44:51) Federal Reserve Note make anything but gold and silver coin a
(3:44:56) tender in payment of debts why because it creates inflation you gotta understand that
(3:45:03) paper money if you can't redeem every piece of paper in a society the amount that you can't
(3:45:10) redeem is inflation or credit credit is
(3:45:15) inflation right pass any bill of attainder huh what is the Bill of
(3:45:20) attainer again a traffic ticket Expos facto law or law
(3:45:26) impairing the obligation of contracts or Grant any title of nobility when they give These Guys these gun permits
(3:45:32) because they got three thousand dollars in their pocket and they're a rich businessman isn't that a title and nobility because they get more rights
(3:45:38) they're more politically correct than you they have rights you see I mean they
(3:45:43) violate so many things that's not funny it's never funny but I'm just saying I I mean you start reading this book folks I
(3:45:50) mean I read it all the time and I always find something new this is kind of a book like the Bible it's one of these books you can read and find something
(3:45:56) out of it all the time the bottom line is you read the
(3:46:02) Constitution and you you holler you don't let these people Jam your Constitution you keep going
(3:46:08) all right all right now let's let's talk about let's talk about trees in here
(3:46:13) let's put this down here what is treason Title 18 this is this is the penal code
(3:46:21) and we're talking about treason whoever owing allegiance to the United States
(3:46:26) Levy's war against them or adheres to their enemies giving them
(3:46:34) Aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere is guilty of treason and
(3:46:39) shall suffer death or shall be in prison not less than five years and or fine not less than the ten
(3:46:47) thousand dollars and shall be impeachable of holding any office under the United States right
(3:46:52) after this section it gives you all of the reasons of how you can be charged with treason but the basic issues come
(3:46:59) under adheres to their enemies giving them Aid and comfort now breaking down the laws
(3:47:05) of our country has also been construed as giving the enemies Aid in Comfort so if they're violating their oath of
(3:47:10) office and they're not a poll in the Constitution that is treason because in so doing they create Anarchy
(3:47:17) In the Land and then that they aid the enemies of our country does that make legal sense
(3:47:23) to you all right here we go we want to talk about Title 20 22 United
(3:47:29) States code section 20286 A basically the part that we want to talk
(3:47:36) about is the the governors and executive directors term of office but basically when we get over here we really want to
(3:47:43) talk about the compensation for services and this is title 22 United States code section 286-a right
(3:47:51) okay okay compensation for services no person shall be entitled to receive any salary
(3:47:58) or other compensation from the United States did everybody get that from the United States Forest Services as a
(3:48:04) governor executive director counselor alternator associate the United States executive director of the fund what are
(3:48:11) we talking about here the international monetary fund shall not be compensated by the fund at a rate in excess of the
(3:48:18) rate provided for an individual occupying positions at level four of the executive schedule under Section 5315 of
(3:48:25) title V United States code all right the United States alternative
(3:48:32) executive director to the fund what fund the international monetary fund shall
(3:48:37) not be compensated by the fund at a rate in excess of the rate provided for an individual occupying a position of level
(3:48:44) five of the executive schedule under Section 5316 of title V United States
(3:48:50) code Secretary of the treasurer show instruct the United States executive director of
(3:48:55) the fund to present to the fund's executive board a comprehensive set of proposals
(3:49:01) consistent with the maintaining high levels of competence of the fund personnel and
(3:49:07) consistent with the Articles of agreement with the objective of assuring that the
(3:49:14) salaries and or other compensations accorded fund employees who who fund
(3:49:20) international monetary fund do not exceed those received by persons filling
(3:49:26) similar levels of responsibility within the national government you got me
(3:49:32) service or Private Industry the secretary shall report these proposals
(3:49:38) right together with any measures adopted by the funds executive board to the
(3:49:44) Congress prior to February 1 1979. now folks when they're talking about the fund they're talking about the
(3:49:50) international monetary funding when they're talking about being paid people like Janet Reno who is a governor of the
(3:49:55) fund is paid by the Imo and who are they talking about the Secretary of Treasury
(3:50:00) shall instruct who now these people are paid by another
(3:50:05) government to our people that is a violation of our
(3:50:11) laws you understand I mean if they catch a congressman on
(3:50:16) the take what happens he's out of there why because it's considered to be unethical
(3:50:22) activity yet this foreign operating operating program this international monetary fund is paying our officers
(3:50:31) as executive officers who whose interest youth do they serve do they serve the United States or do
(3:50:38) they serve the funds does that make sense to you okay to me this is an act of sedition or
(3:50:46) treason the bottom line is they are not operating in the best interest of the United States of America they are
(3:50:52) operating in their interest and they are paid by foreign power and how can they sit in a office of
(3:50:58) government in the United States of America paid by a foreign power it's inconceivable what this is going on
(3:51:03) now you want to find out oh also we want to show them this
(3:51:09) these concurrent resolutions here expressing the sense of the Congress
(3:51:15) regarding the need for the president to seek the Senator's advice and consent to ratification of the United Nations
(3:51:21) convention on the rights of the child John Tanners is in on this he's one of
(3:51:28) our guys too okay now the bottom line is
(3:51:34) they're setting the standards all right on these standards
(3:51:41) whereas it is estimated that every night in the United States at least 100 000 children go to sleep homeless whereas I
(3:51:48) mean they make all these allegations where in the United States has the world's largest gross national product get American children ranked below the
(3:51:54) top 15 nations in regard to the health and well-being whereas in 1989 infant mortality rate for the United States
(3:52:00) ranked 19th in the world being Singapore or Spain I mean they make all these allegations about
(3:52:06) United States and the national Commission on children
(3:52:11) has declared that every child in America needs an excellent education yet approximately 40 percent of the nation's children are at risk of school failure I
(3:52:19) mean they go on and on whereas the United States two million 600 000 children were reported to be abused and
(3:52:24) are neglected in 91. I mean this is ridiculous whereas it's estimated that one million and 800 000
(3:52:30) teenagers were victims of violent crime whereas the Supreme Court has never fully articulated the range of rights to
(3:52:37) be accorded to children under the United States Constitution or fully articulated the manner and the Constitution is applicable to minors
(3:52:43) it is whereas the positive futures of our families communities nations are dependent now
(3:52:49) you keep reading all these whereas is whereas 29 others Nations have signed
(3:52:56) convention indicating their intention to ratify the convention in the future yeah
(3:53:01) then you get down whereas it is essential at the United
(3:53:07) States Santa ratify the convention and rights of the child and begin Implement a convention legal standards in order to
(3:53:12) improve and protect the lives of children believe me they're not trying to protect the lives of children they're trying to create a new federal
(3:53:18) bureaucracy whereas at the world Summit of children in September such and such to sign the
(3:53:24) world declaration to survival protection development of Chile which would include commitment to work and promote earliest possible
(3:53:29) ratification implementation under the United Nations and conventions of the right of the child whereas the House Representatives passed through
(3:53:34) resolution in 101st Congress written president to seek consent of the Senate ratification of the convention of the rights of the child but such action
(3:53:40) having not occurred it is necessary to the Congress employer the President should take action on the convention now and now they want to push it
(3:53:48) all right so you gotta understand folks
(3:53:53) you're not doing this for the children believe me they're doing it because they want to create some new kind of problem
(3:53:59) children tomorrow I apologize to you on behalf of those in my time for the things we didn't do we didn't stop the
(3:54:06) tyrants so your fate could be prevented we watch them steal our freedom but our silence we consented we didn't choose to
(3:54:13) circumvent the Doom you've not escaped while the Bill of Rights was murdered in the Constitution raped some of us were
(3:54:19) lazy and too busy others too afraid to think about our children the ones we have betrayed we say we were too busy to
(3:54:28) be concerned or care to try to ease the burden of the chains we've made you wear a debt of 17 trillion more money than
(3:54:36) exists because we fail to heed God's call of usury resists we could have been
(3:54:42) good Shepherds when the wolf got in the fold he had watched the flame of Freedom die which leaves you in the cold
(3:54:50) we changed our great Republic which was forged in blood for Liberty to a socialist welfare state which we call
(3:54:57) democracy I'm sorry we were so timid betrayed by a selfish generation we left
(3:55:02) yet our remnant of a free and prosperous Nation I'm sorry for our action like sheep we have behaved we could have
(3:55:11) left you Freedom instead you are enslaved children of tomorrow descendants of our land I am sorry we
(3:55:17) allowed this fate you now must understand children of tomorrow educate yourself if by reading the Bible of

(3:55:49) end of transmission so I think you can see here
(3:55:54) at one time they pretend to do all this and yet on the other they do all that
(3:56:01) so I thought this was very important thing to put out on the air
(3:56:06) trying Hammer across okay now we want to cover some other things we want to cover the brentwoods agreement Act
(3:56:14) for about the 1-207 remember I told you sign your name 1-207 UCC
(3:56:20) 1-207 without prejudice here folks
(3:56:25) this is uh the 1-200 dual cell form Commercial Code this section provides
(3:56:30) machinery for the continuation of performance along the lines contemplated by the contract what contract the
(3:56:36) bankruptcy contract it's in 1933 depending all right pending
(3:56:43) dispute by adopting the Mercantile device of going ahead with delivery
(3:56:48) acceptable acceptance or payment without prejudice
(3:56:54) under the protest under Reserve with reservation of all our rights
(3:57:02) and the like all of those all of these phrases completely
(3:57:08) Reserve All rights within the meaning of this section this section therefore
(3:57:15) contemplates that limited as well as general reservations and acceptance
(3:57:22) my party may be made subject to satisfaction of our purchaser
(3:57:30) subject to acceptance by our customer for the light
(3:57:35) this section does not add any new requirement of language of reservation we're not already required by a lot but
(3:57:42) merely provides a specific measure on which a party can rely as he makes or concurs in any
(3:57:52) interim adjustment in the course of performance when they say performance they're talking about contractual
(3:57:58) performance it does not affect or impair the provisions of this act such
(3:58:05) as those under which the buyers right remedies for defect survive acceptance
(3:58:13) without being expressly claimed if notice of the defect is given within
(3:58:20) a reasonable time nor does it disturb the policy of those
(3:58:27) cases which restrict the effect of a waiver of a defect to
(3:58:33) reasonable limits under the circumstances even though no such
(3:58:38) reservation is expressed now this is all what they're talking about when you write down
(3:58:45) without prejudice they're telling you you have a right to reserve your rights
(3:58:51) so I'm telling you to use it and don't screw around
(3:58:57) sufficiency of the reservation the expression can you see that
(3:59:03) any expression indicating an intention to preserve rights is sufficient
(3:59:11) such as without prejudice under protest under reservation with reservation of
(3:59:18) all our rights under duress is another one the code States an explicit reservation must be made explicit
(3:59:25) undoubtedly is used in place of Express to indicate that the reservation must
(3:59:32) not only be expressed but it must also be clear
(3:59:37) under duress that such a reservation was intended in
(3:59:43) advance right the term explicit as used in UCC 1-207 means that which is so
(3:59:51) clearly stated or distinctly set forth that there is no doubt
(3:59:57) as to its meaning okay now that is the reservation I want you to claim I want you to screw around
(4:00:03) I want you to use your head for something other than a hat rack because I'm telling you
(4:00:09) just do it yeah just do it yeah you don't tell them nothing you sign it and
(4:00:15) you walk out when they ask you what that is you say that's something I put down on my signature every time so I know it's me
(4:00:20) okay you're not you didn't learn all this stuff overnight and you're not going to
(4:00:26) give somebody these classes overnight believe me if you think you're going to teach somebody this stuff all night
(4:00:31) you're dreaming it takes a long time of serious study to get to the level of
(4:00:38) where you're at and you're not going to deliver that to anybody overnight so my sincere advice is don't try and do it
(4:00:44) because it ain't going to happen in your lifetime just sign it what you're supposed to do if people want to listen then you let
(4:00:50) them listen if they don't want to listen and you say oh well we want to show off some of these things under executive order of the president
(4:00:56) all persons required to deliver honor before May 1st 1933. let's try and blow
(4:01:02) that up that's a good one that's all your gold and silver I want to make sure we get into all kind
(4:01:08) of arguments here real quickly should we have some gold yes I think you should set aside some serious money to put in I
(4:01:15) think people shouldn't have everything in gold and silver though I think you should have I think you should buy toilet paper and
(4:01:21) I think you should buy food and I think you should buy cough medicine and I
(4:01:26) think you should buy laundry soap I think you should buy you know have some stuff around like you would keep your
(4:01:31) normal business and put a little bit in gold and silver I think you should have a pump shotgun in your closet to defend
(4:01:37) your house something yeah something to defend your house not that you may need it but if
(4:01:43) you do you got it now here we go folks this is the brentwood's agreement Act
(4:01:48) and this is the agreement act that created this problem with this title 22 United States code section 286.
(4:01:57) okay this is heavy duty folks so I remember I
(4:02:04) showed you about treason okay no person shall be entitled to receive any salary or other compensation from
(4:02:11) the United States for services as a government executive director counselor alternator or associate right
(4:02:17) Congress by law authorizes such action neither the president nor any person or
(4:02:23) agency show on behalf of the United States request for consent to any change in the quota
(4:02:29) of the United States under article 3 section 2. the articles of agreement of
(4:02:35) the fund the fund the international monetary fund
(4:02:40) all right let's pull it up here all right they're talking about dollar
(4:02:46) under paragraph six okay that's not what I want I want let's see make any loan to
(4:02:51) the fund or Bank approve the establishment of any additional trust fund for the special benefit of the
(4:02:58) single member or of a particular segment of membership of the fund
(4:03:05) so all right let's see in order to carry out the purposes of the decisions of
(4:03:12) January 1962 of the executive directors of the international monetary fund
(4:03:19) the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to make loans not to exceed to
(4:03:25) looks like billion yeah outstanding at any one time to the
(4:03:30) fund if it sounds like I'm hammering on that fund that's because I am under article 7 section 1 sub paragraph I of
(4:03:39) the Articles of agreement of the fund I mean they set this thing up the Secretary of the Treasury with the
(4:03:45) approval of the president directly or through such agencies as he may designate as authorized for the account
(4:03:51) of the fund established in this section to deal in gold and Foreign Exchange in
(4:03:57) such other instruments of credit and our Securities as he may deem necessary to the consistent constituent you know
(4:04:04) consistent and consistent with the United States obligations in the international
(4:04:09) monetary fund the Secretary of the Treasury shall annually make a report on the operation
(4:04:16) of the fund to the president and to the Congress that makes the Secretary of Treasury what an officer of the fund
(4:04:23) okay the Secretary of Treasury yeah he is guilty the Secretary of Treasury
(4:04:29) is authorized to issue gold certificates in such form and in such denomination as he may determine against any gold held
(4:04:37) by the United States Treasury the amount of gold certificates issued and or outstanding shall at no time exceed the
(4:04:43) value at the legal standard provided in section 2 of per value modification act
(4:04:49) 31 United States code 449 on the date of enactment of this amendment of The Gold
(4:04:56) so held against gold certificates they're in the gold certificates
(4:05:02) all right the amendment made by sections two three four five six and seven of this act shall become effective upon
(4:05:09) entry into the force of the Amendments approved in the resolution number 31-4
(4:05:14) of the Board of Governors of the fund now this is called the brentwood's agreement act folks and this is what set
(4:05:20) up title 22 United States code section 286a which says that these officers are paid out of the fund
(4:05:27) that paid as United States employees a piece
(4:05:35) is there any doubt in your mind now who gets paid where they don't we don't pay them they're paid by somebody else the
(4:05:41) fund who is the fund all those Rich guys that are sitting over in here they're trying to control our country all right
(4:05:47) now okay let's move on here we got things to do I want to show you something else too
(4:05:54) let's look at the very first book of title of the United States codes annotated and I don't care which section
(4:06:00) you grab grab either a lawyers Edition this title has been acted in as positive
(4:06:06) law okay notice a little asterisk and you come down here and all these titles
(4:06:13) I got the little answers they're all part of the law Title 11 bankruptcy title 13 census
(4:06:18) title 14 Coast Guard you know happy rights you got crimes and criminal procedure Title 18 right
(4:06:25) now I want you to notice something as we come over to title 26 here
(4:06:30) title 26 is the Internal Revenue code it's never been enacted until now
(4:06:35) it's a regulation you get it can you get it
(4:06:41) see that look closely title 26 and title 27 do
(4:06:46) you see an asterisk there you don't see one do you well sir that's because there ain't one
(4:06:52) now let's look at the other version the other version is exactly the same and this is the one out of the official U.S
(4:06:58) reports for titles this title has been enacted as well look at all the titles
(4:07:04) that got an asterisk you'll notice again title 26 and title 27 Zippo
(4:07:11) no asterisk everybody see that real clear pull it over no Masters obviously it's never
(4:07:18) been enacted as law how could it be I'll tell you how we got a case over
(4:07:24) here called Erie Railroad versus Tompkins and I'm going to bring it to your attention
(4:07:29) three railroad versus Tompkins is a magnificent court case basically what this court case did
(4:07:39) this court case is recorded at volume 304 United States reports section
(4:07:46) or page 64. this is the start of the case that's 304 volume 304 United States
(4:07:52) reports section 604 now what this case does is it sets up a duality of
(4:07:58) citizenship where the citizens that live with the common law and there are the citizens that live at the national law
(4:08:04) or what is called admiralty or Maritime jurisdiction now the way they get away with putting this title 26 in this title
(4:08:09) 27 out the way they do it is they create this admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction and if you volunteer into it you are in
(4:08:17) it if you step in it it's on you okay so I'm telling you don't do that
(4:08:24) you know what the doctor says every time you go to the doctor you say Doc every time I do this it hurts you know the
(4:08:29) doctor tells you it's don't do that no more you don't do that no more it won't hurt right I'm telling you the same thing
(4:08:36) applies with this don't volunteer how do you volunteer you enter and you watch what you sign number one any evidences
(4:08:42) of contracts where you are an annual tier Maritime jurisdiction says that you are a party
(4:08:48) to the contract so you avoid that when you sign that bank draft to get
(4:08:53) into that bank and that section 9 form you fill out guess what look at the bottom you signed to get into an
(4:08:58) admiralty Maritime jurisdiction what the hell would you want to do that for
(4:09:03) it's illogical when you signed up for that social security check
(4:09:09) so how are we going to remedy this situation on Nash 207 without prejudice
(4:09:18) you sign anything that has to do anything with those guys take the rights if they'll give them to you take the benefits
(4:09:26) but make sure when you sign it you sign it UD 1-207 the not prejudice
(4:09:32) that makes you a common law Citizen and when they pull you into these courts and they claim
(4:09:38) they have jurisdiction over you you say the first thing out of your mouth is your honor me and please the court before this matter goes forward I wish
(4:09:45) to state that I am here on a special appearance as distinguished from a general appearance and I am answering in
(4:09:50) the form of a demure and Emir is an old way of pleading it's an old-fashioned Old Country Barrister
(4:09:57) English way of pleading without granting jurisdiction in other words I'll answer out of courtesy
(4:10:03) and I'll give you an answer out of courtesy but at no time a migrating jurisdiction I put on my Breeze I State
(4:10:09) my name I State the defendant inappropriate Persona and a special appearance is distinguished from a
(4:10:15) general appearance for jurisdictional challenges now I've raised the issue of jurisdictional challenges I'm putting on
(4:10:20) the record it's clearly cognizant once jurisdiction is raised the burden is on the planet to prove jurisdiction
(4:10:25) pursuant to uh McNutt versus General Motors Acceptance Corporation recorded a 56 Supreme Court 502.
(4:10:34) may never be assumed but must be substantively proven by the plan of claimant they don't prove it in a timely fashion
(4:10:41) latches and curves latches as a specie of action or in a party of reasonable intelligence and integrity having a right to take an action as is prescribed
(4:10:47) by law and having failed to timely do so loses our right to proceed so if they
(4:10:53) don't prove it Timely motion to dismiss your own repairs data cause of action for which relief can be
(4:10:58) granted and I'd kind of like to collect my costs and fees for having to defend this frivolous case does that make sense to you all right now let's get into this
(4:11:05) Erie Railroad case this is a railroad case what it's about it's a guy's walking down the track and the board was hanging off the end of the train and
(4:11:11) whacked them upside to head he tried to sue in the state courts the state courts uh
(4:11:17) hammered them so what happened was Erie Railroader flipped around and they
(4:11:23) tried to sue him in the federal courts to get back at them
(4:11:29) and they thought they were pulling a fast one and what happened was the case bounced back on them and guess what when it bounced back it created a very very
(4:11:37) dangerous thing now before this I want you to understand that for a hundred years the law this case was the one that
(4:11:42) was the leading case before this and this was called McCulloch versus
(4:11:47) Maryland the state of Maryland this is a very leading case this is the most heavy case it comes in two sections that's the
(4:11:53) touch out thickness so you're going to be reading for a while this case uphill for 100 plus years practically almost
(4:11:59) 100 years this case is recorded at it's a 1819 case it is an old case
(4:12:07) and it upheld for years the uh single citizenship relationship
(4:12:14) and it deals with the corporations the power of a stabbing Corporation is not a distinct Sovereign power or end of
(4:12:20) government but only the means of carrying into effect other powers which are sovereign whenever it becomes an
(4:12:26) appropriate means of exercising any of the powers given by the Constitution to the government of the United Union it
(4:12:32) may be exercised by that government now basically it sets up relationships the bank of the United States has
(4:12:38) constitutionally a right to establish its branches or other offices in this discount and disposite
(4:12:45) within any state all right the state within which such Branch may be established cannot without violating the
(4:12:51) Constitution tax that Branch right now it goes into some heavy arguments on taxes and some other arguments on on
(4:12:59) programming but I'm telling you here this was the law of the land I want to get a site on this uh for a
(4:13:08) this book was so old when we got it from it should say what buying is [Applause]
(4:13:15) normally they put it in the case and then they'll cite it one time then they'll say everything after that Supra
(4:13:21) I stated it at the beginning I am poor you're right that's not really a good
(4:13:28) that's probably you see these reporters in the early this is 1819 folks that's when this case came down so this was
(4:13:35) going to be you know shortly after the Constitution was signed
(4:13:41) 1791s when the Constitution was signed so it's going to be an early case all right William McCullough defendant well
(4:13:47) the new Branch normally they State the case one place and they stated but anyway to make a long story short
(4:13:53) McCulloch versus Maryland is a very heavy case it was the law of the land and it was
(4:13:58) replaced bye Erie Railroad versus Tompkins there is
(4:14:05) no federal can you see that there's no federal General common law
(4:14:10) Congress has no power to declare substantive rules of common law applicable in a state whether they be
(4:14:17) local in their nature or general whether they be commercial law or in part of the
(4:14:22) law of torts no clause in the Constitution purports to confer
(4:14:29) such a power upon the federal courts except in the matters governed by the Federal Constitution or by acts of
(4:14:35) Congress the law to be applied in any case is the law of the state
(4:14:42) got me and whether the law of the state shall be declared by its legislature in a
(4:14:49) statute or by its highest court in a decision not a matter of federal concern
(4:14:58) now in disapproving the doctrine of the Swift versus Tyson the court does not
(4:15:04) hold unconstitutional section 34 of the federal Judiciary Act of 1789 or any
(4:15:10) other act of Congress mere title 26. it merely declares that by applying the
(4:15:18) doctrine of that case rights which are reserved by the Constitution to the several states have been invaded
(4:15:28) invaded that's why they can get away with having title 26 without having no asterisks
(4:15:34) they don't have to have it in law they're claiming that's an act of Congress and a few voluntarily enter into it
(4:15:39) guess what you bought the whole firm a federal court exercising jurisdiction over such a case on the ground of
(4:15:45) diversity of citizenship what am I talking about diversity of citizenship I'm talking about dual citizenship
(4:15:50) right is not free to treat this question as one of so-called General law
(4:15:58) but must apply the state law as declared by the highest state court
(4:16:04) Swift versus Tennyson overruled the liability of the railroad company for the injury caused by negligent
(4:16:11) operation of its train to its pedestrian on a much used beaten path on its right-of-way Interstate right
(4:16:20) along and near the rails depends in the absence of a federal or state statute
(4:16:26) upon the unwritten law of the state where the accident occurred now what they're trying to do here is
(4:16:32) they're trying to justify the existence of this duality of citizenship between common law citizen
(4:16:40) which you are most of you and this natural National citizen which would
(4:16:46) fall under title 26 United States code but I'm telling you to look up section 6331a of title 26 and you will see that
(4:16:53) the treasurer the secretary treasurer has jurisdiction only over corporations officers or corporations and officers of
(4:16:59) government residing in the District of Columbia and artificial Corporation who are contractors of the fund capiche
(4:17:08) all right now this is an important case if you guys are going to be in this seriously
(4:17:14) battling and want to argue jurisdiction which is a very good defense on almost anything they can pull on you you're
(4:17:20) gonna have to read these cases Erie Railroad versus Tompkins recorded at 304. that's volume 304 U.S page 64 is
(4:17:28) where it starts it's vital that you understand these arguments I just finished battling a United States Attorney and we were
(4:17:34) arguing he's talking about this is all gibberish and I told him I said sir I don't think
(4:17:40) you're well read on the lawn all you got to do is read several of these cases and they'll tell you one there is a duality
(4:17:45) of citizenship two it has to be clearly defined and three I have defined it and now I'm asking you to prove that I'm not
(4:17:51) a Parry or prove that I am a party you tell me it's your burden you're the one making
(4:17:56) the complaint you make the complaint you get the burden to prove who says so mcnut versus
(4:18:02) General Motors Acceptance Corporation 56 Supreme Court Section 5 or page 502.
(4:18:07) you made it you prove it okay you don't prove it timely I motion to dismiss very
(4:18:13) stated cause of action for which relief can be granted and I will beat your little tail
(4:18:19) so I would highly recommend you get the busy to proving it
(4:18:24) yeah if you think the stuff don't work let me tell you something here
(4:18:31) right here [Applause] right today someone came told me motion dismissed
(4:18:37) right United States of America hereby moves pursuant to Federal rules of criminal procedure for leave to dismiss
(4:18:43) the indictment in the cases for the statutes okay [Applause]
(4:18:55) order dismissing indictment which the judge will sign the government had me moved to
(4:19:00) dismissing payment in the case of this court being fully advised and the premise that is ordered in the indictment of B and the hereby is dismissed with prejudice
(4:19:07) and that the defense mind is canceled it is so ordered and judged wherefore the United States requests
(4:19:13) that this court enter the attached order dismissing the indictment without prejudice but we'll figure that out
(4:19:18) we'll fix it see I don't care if we go to court because I know who's going to win
(4:19:24) and I pray to God that he'll help me do that so if they want to go to court I tell
(4:19:30) them make my day when I'm in the court the guy says to me whoa we could get you for an income tax evasion
(4:19:37) and you might win one but you won't win them all I looked at him most commonly and I said
(4:19:42) to him in the clearest and gracious language I said sir I'm gonna advise you to go look in them
(4:19:48) law books real carefully because I'm a taster air I have had occasionally look in them law books and I'm telling you
(4:19:54) sir if you bring that complaint against me I'm going to tell you to make my day
(4:20:01) because I'm pretty serious fellow and I'm not gonna fool with you I'll sue your sacks up and attach everything out
(4:20:06) and make business and hope so the best thing I can tell you is before you make a complaint sir I would highly recommend
(4:20:13) that you seriously consider the merits of your facts before you go writing a bunch of dribble and when we got him
(4:20:20) today he's talking about well your briefs are nothing but gibberish so we asked him he said well
(4:20:25) on our proposed order to have it dismissed you want us to put it down there for a good gibberish shown or just
(4:20:31) generally good car show so you got a little red in her face and storm now
(4:20:36) but the bottom line is if you know your facts and you got your stuff together I'm telling you people out there in TV
(4:20:42) Land you can do this stuff right as God is my judge I I'm a truck driver I'm a I've been an
(4:20:50) engineer for a while I uh I'm a fisherman a hunter and a guide
(4:20:55) I'm a regular person I just read a lot okay I know people like to add stuff in
(4:21:01) the game but I'm a regular citizen of the United States I love my country and its Constitution
(4:21:07) and I I'm not fooling around I want them done or my Constitution and
(4:21:14) I don't think that's too much to ask I think a lot of fine soldiers paid for it maybe we had a lot of Patriots some of
(4:21:20) the finest people I've ever known have paid for it I especially uh Tout
(4:21:26) Daniel castu who was the editor of the constitutionalist newspaper and
(4:21:33) these the initiator and starter of the Justice prose movement in this area
(4:21:41) he was a great man he was a courageous man he was found shot to death in his
(4:21:46) home with a bullet in his nose because obviously he stuck his nose in places it shouldn't had on a bin
(4:21:51) he was a tireless defender of the people and the Constitution
(4:21:56) many a time we Cruise the countryside doing meetings hither Indiana
(4:22:02) he wore a white cowboy hat which we used to joke about good guys wear white hats uh he was an exceptional personality he
(4:22:09) lost everything he owned fighting to the death and uh
(4:22:15) I I especially offer my my
(4:22:23) serious prayers for his soul and for the soul of all Patriots who
(4:22:29) have suffered tremendous things to put on this Constitution and to keep us going
(4:22:34) the people with the wwcr radio there uh God bless you
(4:22:41) uh Radio free America Tom Valentine Bill Cooper
(4:22:48) the infamous uh Jack mcland from Vampire killer 2000 the uh
(4:22:55) there's a serious serious Battlers out here folks myself included there's quite
(4:23:02) a few Patriots all around um I can't tell you the names of the people
(4:23:10) that I feel absolutely privileged to know because the list would be so long here it would take another two hours just for the tape
(4:23:16) but I can tell you some exceptional people and some of them are on Vine and
(4:23:21) they can't be doing that so so I I'm respecting their you know some
(4:23:27) of the things the infamous Eugene May EJ May uh
(4:23:33) there's just so many the infamous no tax Jim James gordonline uh
(4:23:39) I mean the names are endless um so I'm telling you folks out here
(4:23:45) there's a lot of good people out here that are pulling for you that have risked a whole lot have gone to jail have stood out
(4:23:51) rain protesting [Music] the infamous day Franklin who was one of
(4:23:58) the most leading arguers on constitutional issues of admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction
(4:24:04) um the outstanding uh art Morris who published the book
(4:24:10) the greatest window ever told which is about 4 000 pages of documentary evidence on income tax situations
(4:24:18) we're going to share you a couple of arguments in the end and then we're going to kind of close it off here
(4:24:23) until the next time but uh all right I want to thank you very much
(4:24:28) for inviting me into your home and uh hopefully we have more Duty tears and at the same time you will have a new uh
(4:24:35) love of your constitution in your country and that you will live push like hell to make sure these people
(4:24:41) understand hey this is America pal last time I checked there's a flag and I pull out there and it's an American flag we
(4:24:46) don't want no blue flag out there everyone want that American flag up here and we got a constitution and we're
(4:24:52) going to keep it if you don't like it move preferably someplace out of here like
(4:24:59) Russia or other places if you like that kind of government go for it knock yourself out that's what that's what
(4:25:05) free America is all about you gotta write the any idea you like so you don't injure
(4:25:11) your neighbor you gotta write the Free Speech but you can't yell fire in a crowded theater at me
(4:25:17) does that make sense okay you don't like it here move
(4:25:23) you want you don't want to exercise your constitutional rights that's your prerogative but if you get abused don't
(4:25:28) say we didn't tell you because um God kind of wants us to do this thing
(4:25:35) because this is this is his holy land and he's hoping that we're going to have enough hair on our tail feather to do it
(4:25:42) now I want to get into a couple other arguments one of the things I want to tell you about is procedure if you're going to go to court
(4:25:48) and you're going to be your own attorney by the way this is the infamous no tax gym he just died God Rest his soul
(4:25:55) the infamous James gordonline I helped the gentleman do his appeal
(4:26:01) briefs to the U.S Supreme Court and I can tell you he was one hell of a gentleman he can quote tragedy and hope
(4:26:07) Quigley's tragedy and Hope from uh from the hip from memory
(4:26:12) and he just passed away just recently he died I want you to see how he died too
(4:26:18) or as it says he was alone when he died Monday
(4:26:24) and no Services planned and they cremated his body he fought to the end to his last day he
(4:26:32) was on the mark Scott program there's another exceptional Patriot Mark Scott I I can't speak highly enough for the
(4:26:38) courage it takes to come on the radio and tell God's truth so there's a lot of people like him
(4:26:44) Tommy McIntyre uh Mike Reagan now we could get you a list of my own there's
(4:26:50) Patriots that come on and tell it like it is JP McCarthy is another one that gets down here and tells it like it is
(4:26:57) I remember this one casual time he got Gus Holland and JP said to Gus Hall he says Gus
(4:27:03) don't you get tired of losing because Gus was running for president around the Communist Party ticket and Gus turned to
(4:27:09) him and he said JP what makes you think we're losing he said we've implemented every plank of
(4:27:14) the Communist Manifesto we just haven't got the guns from the people yet and JP turned to him and said yeah and you ain't going to get him from the people
(4:27:19) what do you think of that well folks what do you think of that they're working on it aren't they
(4:27:26) huh no you're gonna go to court and you're gonna be your own attorney
(4:27:31) you got to be sure you got to keep records you go to court you write it down you get anything in
(4:27:37) paperwork you write it down you send them anything in paperwork you write it down you got me don't be screwing around
(4:27:43) on me because I'm going to tell you some of these things got dates and times and things that you got to do and if you
(4:27:48) don't take care of business guess what they ain't gonna take care of it for you you're your own attorney if you want if you want to be your own
(4:27:54) attorney you got to have records you got to keep on top of things so every time you do something you write it down
(4:28:01) you make sure you can go back and say yeah I remember on such and such a date at such such time this happened and this
(4:28:06) happened and this happened you can construct a chronological order of events okay
(4:28:12) now also write down all important numbers to anybody that has anything that's got to be done
(4:28:18) okay now what we want to get into is we want to get into some serious
(4:28:24) arguments on taxes okay
(4:28:31) well so we should tell you that if anybody violates your rights
(4:28:37) okay title 42 United States code section 1983. everybody got this can you see it
(4:28:45) every person who under color of Statute ordinance or regulation customer usage
(4:28:51) of any state or territory or the District of Columbia subjects or causes
(4:28:56) to be subjected any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation
(4:29:04) of any rights privileges or immunity secured by the Constitution and the laws shall be liable to the party injured in
(4:29:12) an action at law suit inequity or other proper proceeding for the redress
(4:29:17) for the purpose of this section any act of Congress applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia why do you
(4:29:24) think they said that because they're members of the fund and
(4:29:30) there they are under title 26 section 6331a
(4:29:36) shall be considered to be a statute of the District of Columbia
(4:29:42) now does everybody understand about admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction I know you don't but not not a little bit
(4:29:49) they have created a duality of citizenship under the 14th Amendment
(4:29:55) they're claiming there's common law rights which everybody gets their constitution and there's National rights
(4:30:02) where you waive all your Constitution now which did you want does that sound like a good deal
(4:30:08) sounds like you're being ripped to me here we got the 1-207 remember 1-207

(4:31:43) them are coordinated between Michigan Indiana Ohio and Wisconsin

(4:32:08) look at all the ones here in Michigan Indiana and Ohio or Illinois
(4:32:14) yeah there is I know I know I know they prop up and they call themselves
(4:32:22) okay and then they got battle groups United Nations battle groups I mean we've had reports of Russian troops
(4:32:27) being in Michigan all summer and we got positive sightings by people at a retired military Colonels and above
(4:32:36) and we know they were at Camp Grayling this summer so I'm telling you folks the time to
(4:32:42) wake up is now wake up America before it's too late
(4:32:47) before you lose your god-given rights to some foreign potentate
(4:32:52) they might think that you uh you look like a sucker
(4:32:59) I mean you want to buy any apples off that card I ain't buying no apples off that cart because I know they're all rotten okay now we want to get into um
(4:33:10) the next thing we want to get into is demolition right we want to get into taxes seriously
(4:33:17) closed for today now those of you who have been in militia groups and everybody's getting all panicky let's
(4:33:23) understand a few things about the militia whether you like it or not you are in the militia in the state of
(4:33:29) Michigan and I will tell you right where it says that [Applause]
(4:33:34) article 17 militia right here what does it say
(4:33:41) this is from the night 1850 Constitution all the way back in our state to the Northwest Territories they treaty they
(4:33:48) have a militia the SE an example of what they're talking about the militia shall be composed of all able-bodied male
(4:33:55) citizens between the ages of 18 and 45 years except such as are Exempted by
(4:34:00) laws of the United States and of the state but all such citizens of any religious denomination whatever who from
(4:34:08) Scruples of conscience right in other words if you're a conscientious objector maybe adverse to bearing arms shall be
(4:34:16) excused there from upon such conditions as shall be prescribed by law and they have conscientious objective
(4:34:24) dances okay and you go to the 1908 Constitution just to show you this is the God's truth
(4:34:31) 1908 Michigan Constitution and the Michigan militia show be composed of all able-bodied male citizens between the
(4:34:38) ages of 18 and 45 years of age except such as are Exempted by laws of the United States or of this state but all
(4:34:45) such citizens of any religious denomination who from Scruples of conscience may be adverse to bearing
(4:34:52) arms shall be excused there from upon such conditions as shall be prescribed by love okay
(4:34:58) now that's a 1908 Constitution now you come up here and this just lets
(4:35:04) you know the trend the trend here now
(4:35:10) we're in the 1963 Constitution oh I wanted to show you a little diverse
(4:35:16) thing here this right here common law and statutes and continuance
(4:35:21) in Michigan the common law and the statute laws now enforce not repugnant
(4:35:26) to this constitution shall remain in force unto a expire by their own limitations or a change demented
(4:35:32) repealed so the common law is prevailing simulation here
(4:35:37) we go now notice folks as the thing as the thing goes on it
(4:35:43) gets shorter and shorter here's your militia this is article 3 section four the militia Shelby organized equipped
(4:35:49) and disciplined as provided by law that's all you get now now when you look in the beginning of this constitution
(4:35:56) there is an there is a empowering statutory a phrase that says
(4:36:02) all constitutions before everything they had in them are carried forward to this
(4:36:08) Constitution and that's how they're allowed to do this so what would happen in this case because they haven't clearly defined it
(4:36:14) here they would have to go back in the law to the previous Constitution which would be the 1908 Constitution which we
(4:36:20) just read to you so this wouldn't be the militia shall be
(4:36:25) composable able-bodied male citizens 18 to 45 years of age so that would be the controlling one because that's as
(4:36:30) prescribed by law just like they say does everybody see that now
(4:36:37) the bottom line here folks is a lot of people are all upset about the militia all the militias is concerned citizens
(4:36:44) that are worried about their constitution getting flushed down a toilet we're not putting up with that stuff
(4:36:51) we want people to understand that we love the Constitution we love our country and we're not screwing
(4:36:57) around all right here we go generally
(4:37:03) the militia shall be organized equipped and discipline is provided by law now let's get into that
(4:37:09) single section is substituted for all of this relating to the militia in the present 1908 Constitution remember I
(4:37:16) told you about empowering the existing article ties the legislature down to an
(4:37:22) outvoted concept of what the militia should be you believe that why our four Fighters will be rolling over in their
(4:37:28) grave details as to organizing human disciplining the militia are left through the legislative enactment in the
(4:37:34) interest of the flexibility and future requirements ah does that mean future requirements if it got nasty and down
(4:37:40) and dirty we would have our militia come back sounds good to me I could go for that the bottom line is
(4:37:48) the people that know what's going around are not screwing around they grind the militia there we go all right cool article nine
(4:37:54) let's pull this out the militia organization and discipline the
(4:38:00) legislature provide by law for organizing and disciplining the militia in such manner as they shall deem expedient not incompatible with the
(4:38:07) Constitution and the laws of the United States but they're not doing it right
(4:38:13) the legislature should provide for efficient discipline of the officers Commission in that commission and that
(4:38:18) musicians and or may provide by law for the organization and discipline of the volunteer companies
(4:38:23) volunteer companies notice that volunteer companies huh
(4:38:28) Office of the militia shall be elected or appointed in such manner as the legislature shell from time to
(4:38:35) time direct and shall be commissioned by the governor the governor shall have the power to
(4:38:41) call forth the militia to execute the laws of the state to suppress insurrections and repel invasions that's
(4:38:47) what our forefathers had in mind in the animal issue now if they're going to invade us they're going to change our
(4:38:52) money they're going to shut down our constitution that's why the militia needs to be organized that's why you
(4:38:57) need to be down there talking to a militia that's why you need to be joining the militia I don't care what
(4:39:03) church you go to I don't care what color national origin ethnic background
(4:39:08) you come from you need to be down to the militia and you need to be talking to them folks about this is the United
(4:39:13) States of America and I will protect it and its constitutional form of government and by doing that if we do an
(4:39:20) insufficient numbers most probably what will happen is the New World Order scammers will
(4:39:27) realize ah the people woke up oh we screwed up we'll have to wait another 300 years to try and Pull It Again
(4:39:33) and let's hope that's what happens if that isn't what happens then the militia will defend the Republic just like what our forefathers intended
(4:39:41) and we will defend the Republic as we always do with vigor
(4:39:46) and we will have a government by Constitution that American flag will be on that pool out there and anybody that
(4:39:51) wants to try something different hey knock yourself out but planning a very severe battle
(4:39:57) because we will never give up the United States of America its constitutional government or our American flag or our
(4:40:03) American Heritage so this idea that you're gonna wear us out tie us down otherwise skew us around is nothing but
(4:40:09) a lot of who done it ain't going to happen in your lifetime [Music] as a matter of fact your lifetime may
(4:40:16) not be that long either because we try traders in this country
(4:40:24) and the bottom line is the penalty for treason his death and it's not our purpose to threaten our
(4:40:31) course or otherwise intimidate any person but we want you to understand that this is the United States of America this is a country governed by
(4:40:37) constitutional law that that constitutional law prescribed penalties for criminal acts and that those
(4:40:42) criminal Acts can be punished by a lawful means we're asking all persons
(4:40:49) that are involved in all walks of government are there any areas of the law to please please please
(4:40:56) let's get back to the Constitution and quit screwing around let's just get back
(4:41:03) to what's supposed to be done and quit screwing around pull back your Federalist Papers and
(4:41:10) let's start reading find out everything that's in this book
(4:41:15) is directly applicable today we need to do it over we need to get back to a gold and silver
(4:41:21) standard we need to get back to a serious means of trade expedience that's
(4:41:27) going to hold the standards of our country even we won't have this inflation we won't have this ridiculous
(4:41:32) Market situation we're asking you please before God we're
(4:41:38) asking you we want our constitution we want it back we want all the American principles that we stand for that our
(4:41:44) brave soldiers died for and we're asking you to please quit screwing around let's get down to Brass
(4:41:51) Texas you've been feeding the pablum to the babies too long we're waiting believe me we're way idiot you may not
(4:41:57) think so but I'm here to tell you we're way ahead of you you're going to wake up someday and
(4:42:02) you're going to be shocked we're going to be all standing out there smiling because you're going to be the one that's asleep not us
(4:42:09) we know what we're talking about we're not fooling around we want you to honor our constitution
(4:42:17) God Bless America we want you to keep us safe we want to we want to be into the 21st century
(4:42:23) stronger than we were in the 17th century I'm not fooling around so please
(4:42:29) now we can go into this book and this book clearly establishes they never wanted to have a militia or a standing
(4:42:35) army they only trusted you listen to some of these arguments in here
(4:42:41) okay but it is said that the laws of the Union are to be the supreme law of the
(4:42:47) land what inference can be drawn from this or what would you what would they amount to if they were not to be Supreme
(4:42:53) it is evident they would amount to nothing a law by the very meaning of the term
(4:42:58) includes Supremacy is the rule which those to whom it is prescribed are bound
(4:43:04) to observe this results from every political Association if individuals
(4:43:09) enter into a state of society of laws of that Society must be the Supreme regulator of their conduct
(4:43:15) if a number of political societies entered into a larger political Society the laws which the latter may enact
(4:43:22) pursuant to the powers entrusted and trusted to it by its Constitution must
(4:43:27) necessarily be Supreme over those societies and the individuals of whom they are composed of it would otherwise
(4:43:33) be a mere treaty dependent on good faith of the Prairies and not a government which is only another word for a
(4:43:39) political power and Supremacy but it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of larger society which are not
(4:43:45) pursuant to its constitutional power but which are invasions of the residuary
(4:43:50) authorizes of the smaller societies will become the supreme law of the land these
(4:43:56) will be merely a subversipation which is kind of what's going on and will deserve to be treated as such
(4:44:02) hence we perceive if the clause which declares the supremacy of the laws of the Union like the one we we have just
(4:44:08) before considered only declares a truth which flows immediately and necessarily
(4:44:14) from the institution of the federal government it will not I presume have escaped observation that it expressly
(4:44:21) confines the supremacy to laws made pursuant to the Constitution which I
(4:44:26) mentioned merely as an instance of caution in the convention since the limitation would have been to be
(4:44:31) understood through though it had not been expressed though a law therefore
(4:44:37) for laying a tax for a use of the United States would be Supreme in its nature and could not legally be opposed or
(4:44:43) controlled yet a law for abrogating and preventing the collection of attacks laid by the authority of the state unless upon imports and exports would
(4:44:50) not be the supreme law of the land but undercipation of power not granted by the Constitution as far as an improper
(4:44:57) accumulation of taxes on the same object might tend to render The Collection difficult or precarious
(4:45:03) this would be a mutual inconvenience not arising from the superiority or
(4:45:09) defect of the power now we want to get into some serious arguments here we want to go to page 108
(4:45:17) about the middle of the page accept this to the rule of apportionment the United States have indefinite
(4:45:23) discretion to make requisitions for men and money that means they can ask but they have no authority to raise either
(4:45:29) by regulations extending to the individual citizens of America that's why we don't have a title 26 that
(4:45:35) applies to you the consequences of this is that though in theory their resolution concerning
(4:45:42) those objects are laws constitutionally binding on the members of the Union yet in practice they are mere recommendations which this States
(4:45:48) observe or disregard at their option
(4:45:54) the intent of the framers Cohen versus Virginia six week two eighteen twenty one says this is the
(4:45:59) exact intent is it pretty hard for you to understand what their intent was they never intended to have an internal
(4:46:06) revenue ever they hated people that operated like that
(4:46:14) operated a tyranny against the people all right let's get on with this
(4:46:19) wise politicians will be cautious about fettering the government with restrictions that cannot be observed
(4:46:25) because they know that every breach of the fundamental laws though dictated by necessity impairs that sacred reverence
(4:46:32) which ought to be maintained in the breast of rulers towards the constitution of a country and forms a
(4:46:37) precedent for other breaches where the same plea of necessity does not exist at all or is less urgent and palpable
(4:46:45) Publius and it teaches us in addition to the rest how unequal parchment Provisions
(4:46:51) are to struggle with public necessity you know I mean you start reading you
(4:46:59) got to read don't sit there like a bump on a laundry get all kind of good stuff going here I
(4:47:05) could I could sit here and read this to you all night this constitution
(4:47:10) of the United States that's what you mean in person sir of and all trees made or which show we made under the authority of the United States shall be
(4:47:16) the supreme law of land the judges in every state shall be bound there by anything in Constitution or laws of any state to the contrary is notwithstanding
(4:47:23) the Indiscreet Zeal of the adversaries to the Constitution has betrayed them into an attack on this part of it as
(4:47:30) also without which it would have been evidently and radically defective to be
(4:47:36) fully sensible of this we need only suppose for a moment that the supremacy of the state's Constitution had been
(4:47:42) left complete with a saving clause in their favor in the first place as these constitutions invest the state
(4:47:48) legislature with absolute sovereignty in all cases not accepted but the existing Articles of Confederation all the
(4:47:53) authorities contained in the proposed Constitution remember I told you about how they tied them together so far as they exceed those enumerated
(4:48:01) in the confederation would have been annulled
(4:48:06) see that and the new Congress would have been reduced to the same impotent condition with their predecessors
(4:48:13) I mean these people were Wise Way Beyond their years and this talks about the
(4:48:18) militia they never wanted to have a standing army never they always wanted the people to defend
(4:48:24) by a militia they wanted the militia to be there ready to kick tail if there needed me they wanted to have a Paul Revere running down young the British
(4:48:30) are coming the British are coming or whoever somebody they called them Minutemen they call them Minutemen for a reason
(4:48:37) because they wanted you to grab your kit and be out on the road in a minute ready to kick tail and repel all borders
(4:48:45) that's the way our forefathers thought now they were wise men who had come from a
(4:48:50) a tyrannical environment in the European market places they knew exactly what was going on and they weren't screwing
(4:48:56) around and the bottom line is they were deadly serious and they were ready to sign their life their they pledged their life
(4:49:02) their their future their their fortunes and everything so that we could
(4:49:07) have this Constitution and I think we kind of owe them a debt because a lot of them died miserably as poppers because
(4:49:14) they dared to sign the Declaration of Independence and the King went after them were the Vengeance do you understand
(4:49:20) now the bottom line here is we gotta we got a duty we're gonna finish this thing up we want to do some stuff on taxes and
(4:49:26) then we're gonna we're gonna be out here we're gonna do two things on taxes one is going to be on Title 31 United
(4:49:31) States code section 742 and we're going to Rattle it off if you want the argument later you'll have to get back with us okay
(4:49:39) Bill 31 United States code and we're going to quote it except is otherwise provided by law all
(4:49:46) stocks bonds treasury notes and other obligations of the United States government shall be exempt from the state Municipal and local Authority this
(4:49:53) exemption extends to every form of Taxation that would require you to the obligations are the interest that you're on or both be considered directly or
(4:50:00) indirectly in the computation of the tax see Memphis Bank versus state of Tennessee at elgarner notice this is
(4:50:08) everybody got that that's recorded at volume 459 us page 392.
(4:50:15) okay right here can you see that okay now what this case is this is a
(4:50:22) Supreme Court case that says Title 31 United States code section 742 is the supreme law of land
(4:50:28) and it does so on a diversity of tax arguments based on
(4:50:33) discriminatory franchise of bondholdings but basically what the Supreme Court said was Title 31 section 742 was the
(4:50:40) supreme law of land recorded right in here is exactly what I just quoted to you
(4:50:45) right here except as otherwise provided by law notice it says all stock spans treasure notes and other obligations the
(4:50:52) United States shall be exempt from State taxation my or understate your municipal or local
(4:50:57) Authority now what does this mean what are they talking about here this exemption extends to every form of Taxation that would require that either
(4:51:04) the obligations or the interest you're on or both be considered directly or indirectly in the computation of the tax
(4:51:09) this is a unique test epoxy when the states went off the Article 1 Section 10 gold and silver
(4:51:14) standard you can't pay anyway because of Michigan compile laws act 21.153 you cannot
(4:51:22) tender anything I didn't go over the silver coin to an officer of the government without being a party to a felony on top of that how do they figure the
(4:51:29) taxes let's look at our property taxes this is a big issue a lot of people get involved with this property taxes
(4:51:34) they're tired of being taxed right out of their home this tax argument is specifically for you
(4:51:42) they come to your house they set a value on your house they tell you that oh uh your house is worth a hundred thousand
(4:51:47) dollars so we're gonna tax it at a 50 interest which would be fifty thousand dollars that's a 50 amortization value
(4:51:54) we'll figure your house is a fifty thousand dollar uh bracket area and then we're gonna go seven points on that
(4:52:00) seven percent and or whatever the percentage is now stop for a second here
(4:52:05) how did they figure the value on your house only said fifty thousand dollars there
(4:52:12) is no dollars what dollars you ain't got no dollars you got dollars I ain't got no dollars dollars or what dollars of
(4:52:19) coffee beans I don't think so the bottom line is they stay talking Federal Reserve notes and they're
(4:52:25) putting the commodity item at the at the reserve notes now what did they just do accepts otherwise provided by law oh
(4:52:31) stocks bonds treasury notes what is it what is the Federal Reserve Note it's a treasury note in other obligations of the United
(4:52:38) States what what obligations title 12 section 411 says the said notes shall be deemed to be obligations of the United
(4:52:44) States government whoops now wait a minute let's see let's
(4:52:50) look at this again except as otherwise provided by law all stocks bonds treasury notes and other obligations of
(4:52:55) the United States shall be exempt from taxation buyer understate or Municipal of local Authority does that mean they can't
(4:53:02) figure a tax by use and obligation to the United States government you're right you're
(4:53:08) absolutely right this exemption extends to every form of Taxation that would require either the obligations
(4:53:14) or the interest they're on or both be considered directly or indirectly in the computation of the tax
(4:53:21) now what are they doing when they figure this 50 amortization of value and then they add so many points percent on and
(4:53:28) they attacked that on and they they saw you owe us this much
(4:53:33) aren't they using Federal Reserve notes indirectly they are aren't they and they're forbidden from doing that
(4:53:38) and the Supreme Court says this is the supreme law of land well guess what folks this case was originally brought in a
(4:53:44) matter of people versus Shepherd out of Lansing and after that case they went in all the
(4:53:50) law books and they pulled out Title 31 section 742 that's how scared they are this title
(4:53:56) we went to Shepherd citations and we noted it in Shepherd citations there was no note that says a nulled repair
(4:54:02) repealed or otherwise transferred to some other law
(4:54:09) there's a hole there folks it starts at seven it starts at Title 31 section 734
(4:54:14) and there's a hole and then it goes to 752. what happened
(4:54:19) here they went in all the law books and pulled this argument out why do you think they did that
(4:54:24) because every state in the Union that went off the gold and silver standard in our article on Section 10 was locked out
(4:54:30) are you taxing the citizenry in any capacity by the use of obligations of the United States government that's the
(4:54:35) only thing you got in your hand folks so rather than play that game they went in all the law books and pulled it out
(4:54:41) then they went in Shepherd citations and instead of putting a note down there as to what happened they just created a void
(4:54:47) what is that evidence of fraud fraud that's not fraud void the contract
(4:54:54) last time I checked it dude now I want you to pay attention to this stuff and get get locked in on this
(4:55:00) argument don't try this until you've at least practiced a little bit but anybody that's getting jammed on
(4:55:06) their property taxes or any other taxes for the state lock their heels that's all I got to say
(4:55:13) okay now we're gonna go into one last argument on income taxes
(4:55:18) and I'm not advising you as your attorney I'm telling you what I have found is a scholar
(4:55:24) in the law books I have found these arguments and if you want to use them that's your free choice
(4:55:30) this is America last time I checked you ever write under the Constitution
(4:55:36) the Constitution of the United States is a supreme law of the land
(4:55:41) we got a unique argument here it says in Article 1 Section 9 paragraph
(4:55:49) four most clearly no capitation or other Direct Tax shall be laid
(4:55:55) unless by the enumeration or addition here and before directed to be taken and that's in article one section two Clause 2 which says income taxes and
(4:56:01) representation shall be by apportionate which I will show you I like to show
(4:56:07) everybody the rules all right go on section two Clause two
(4:56:13) right so everybody's on the same way when all right go on section two Clause two
(4:56:21) where are we at here article one section two Clause two
(4:56:28) representatives and direct taxes shall be by apportionment among the several states which may be included within the
(4:56:34) union according to their respective numbers which shall be determined by adding the whole number all right we got
(4:56:39) the idea article one section 9 Clause four no capitation or other deck tax shall be
(4:56:47) laid unless by the proportion to the census or enumeration as hearing before directly to be taken well folks they're not using the senses they're not using a
(4:56:54) portion of an issue at all they're evading it totally now there's several arguments here and
(4:57:00) it's very catchy so I want you to pay close attention all right one of the arguments I want to share
(4:57:06) with you is brought by an Infamous outstanding judge judge beers
(4:57:12) someone that actually lived the movie Cheaper by the Dozen he went out and had two wives and had 12 kids by each
(4:57:19) man's got a lot of guts all them kids went to college too I want to tell you every one of them I know some of them personally myself one of them is the
(4:57:27) director of the law library at Oakland Oakland County Court
(4:57:32) excellent people the judge beers got mad and he called up Jimmy Carter and he told him look we
(4:57:38) need to have a raise for our judges because we're not keeping up with inflation etc etc and Jimmy told him no way Jose and so
(4:57:46) judge beers filed in court the case of Evans versus Gore recorded at 253 us-245
(4:57:54) of the Internal Revenue Service because he claimed that the Internal Revenue Service
(4:58:00) diminished his salary during his continuance in office we all know
(4:58:07) Supreme Court inferior Court shall hold their office during the behavior and shall receive for their services a valuable compensation which shall not be
(4:58:13) administering your continuance and office that's article three paragraph one
(4:58:18) wait I'm sorry let's see yeah let's see
(4:58:24) yeah yeah the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in the Supreme Court in such inferior courts as May from time to
(4:58:31) time ordained and establish it judges both of the Supreme Court inferior Court show hold your office during good
(4:58:36) behavior and shall receive at stated times where their services a compensation which shall not be
(4:58:43) diminishing their continuous in office well guess what your honor they diminished my salary during my continuous and obvious you'll notice
(4:58:49) that there was no diminishment specified so all diminishment is forbidden okay and since all diminishment is forbidden
(4:58:56) I am constitutionally immune from your income taxes Supreme Court came back and said
(4:59:02) excellent argument the 16th Amendment didn't create any new taxing power whatsoever and clearly judge Evans is
(4:59:10) immune from income taxes based on the article 3 paragraph one
(4:59:16) constitutional immunity so up jump the devil in the deep blue sea Jimmy Carter was most unhappy so he had
(4:59:22) to give the judges all a raise to shut him up and he took his wrath out on Judge fears
(4:59:28) and he went and published the fact that judge beers was a bigamist and he he kind of trashed him and got
(4:59:34) him dispared and thrown off the bench which I didn't think was a very nice thing to do at all
(4:59:39) this judge beers was a good judge now how does this affect you basically this
(4:59:47) case of evidence versus score makes two basic statements one the 16th Amendment didn't create any new taxing power and
(4:59:52) two there was what an acceptable possible immunity
(4:59:59) to the income tax right whoa I said let's go back to article on section 9 paragraph four
(5:00:05) no capitation or other deck tax shall be laid unless by the rule of apportionment is hearing before directed to be taken
(5:00:10) didn't I have a right to be free from a direct tax on my property a direct tax is one where I actually come in your pocket and I tax it
(5:00:17) I had a right to be free from a direct tax on my property unless by the rule of apportionment that's hearing before a directly to be taken in Article 1
(5:00:23) Section two clause 2. does that mean I'm constitutionally immune sure does
(5:00:29) but you have to tell them and demand that it's a direct tax you guys say it's a direct tax on my property now what are
(5:00:36) they going to do they're going to come around and tell you this is an undertale 26 this is under title 27 and that really you're a
(5:00:43) coal miner you're a minor of some kind or you're a manufacturing handgun someplace while
(5:00:49) you ask them all right let's see the farm 4456 they'll send you the form 4456 and sure
(5:00:55) enough they're going to have you down under some excise tax where they're charging you under batf we're having
(5:01:00) some fraudulent claim that you're involved in mining or something that requires an
(5:01:07) excise tax and that for the privilege of doing business you have to pay a fee
(5:01:12) because you're a corporation an officer of a corporation or you reside in a
(5:01:18) District of Columbia now let's ask it 31a of the code look up section 6331a
(5:01:25) those are the only guys that the treasury Department can Levy against the only ones
(5:01:31) are you any of those no how could that be you're not any of those they can't Levy
(5:01:38) against you if they can't Levy against you there's no jurisdiction over you got me does that make clear I mean if they
(5:01:43) could Levy against you they'd have jurisdiction now if they Levy against you and you pay them guess what you just gave him jurisdiction
(5:01:50) you sign your documents you sign your W-4 form you don't put down there like I told you UD 1-07 without a Prejudice
(5:01:56) guess what you're in yeah so you think
(5:02:02) now isn't that fraud doesn't fraud avoid the contract
(5:02:11) you need to read folks we need to get you down here we need to read there's so many beautiful arguments in here I mean
(5:02:16) we can just Hammer them what is income there is no income defined anywhere in the code oh section 61a the code says
(5:02:23) income is Wages no it doesn't it says section 64 61a of the code says this is a list of sources from which income
(5:02:29) could be derived not necessarily is B but could be and it's compensation now think about
(5:02:35) the word compensation look at blacks Law Dictionary you're going to find out compensation to make whole
(5:02:41) now if you're out there and you painted your neighbors burn and he told you to give you 300 by by
(5:02:47) Christmas all right you painted the barn and Christmas came and he didn't paid 300.
(5:02:53) when you have a loss on paper you would wouldn't you and wouldn't you ever gain he would wouldn't he now let's say he
(5:02:59) paid he paid your dollars what do you get do you have a loss no does he have a
(5:03:04) gain no what happened an equal exchange of property what happened you changed your time of life property in labor
(5:03:11) for his consideration you have
(5:03:17) a zero zero balance you earn a head and he isn't mine and you aren't mine and he
(5:03:22) is an ant that is compensation that's what it means to make whole now what
(5:03:28) happens if he doesn't pay you doesn't he have a game he would have a profit wouldn't you realize profit again he got
(5:03:33) you to work for me he didn't pay you right and you would have a loss right does that make sense to you
(5:03:39) now the only way you would have
(5:03:45) the only way you would have income by the way they Define it Russian reverse is Union Pacific and some of these other cases pilot courses Farmers loan and
(5:03:52) Trust first you would have to have a realized gain from some Source right before the period under consideration
(5:03:59) happened now did you get paid anymore and then you agreed to you didn't did you you got paid 300 you
(5:04:05) agreed to 300 you got 300 if you got 301 dollars you had a game that if you were a corporation and
(5:04:11) officer Corporation and a person that reside in the District of Columbia was an officer of the government you'd have a
(5:04:18) income but you're not any of those you're not a
(5:04:24) corporation you're not an officer of a corporation you're not reside and you're in the District of Columbia as an officer of government so you're first of
(5:04:29) all not even in the game second of all you didn't receive any anything above what you bargained for
(5:04:37) okay so you don't have a realized profit or gain before the period under
(5:04:42) consideration was commenced so you don't have any income what you have is compensation
(5:04:51) before it can become income it would have to be corporate property you'd have to be a corporation and you'd have to
(5:04:57) have a realized profit again you don't have it so don't tell anybody you have income you ain't got none
(5:05:02) every time you volunteer to get in that you get in trouble don't volunteer didn't they tell you that in the Army don't volunteer
(5:05:08) you volunteer you get the broom and you get to drive it around the floor just ask me I'll tell you I know
(5:05:14) now the bottom line is this there's a lot of things that you need to know the biggest thing is that you need to get a
(5:05:20) hold of one of these books and you need to read it cover to cover
(5:05:25) and you need to be able to Rattle it just like I chose it you need to trust your God in heaven
(5:05:31) above and whom you should put all your trust in love and you need to kick some tail and try
(5:05:38) and coordinate this program format you understand Holy Bible
(5:05:44) you got it you need to get with the program we can't keep screwing around like this

(5:06:33) the loop put it on the other end of that fishing line pull that fishing line up in the air gets you 100 foot antenna
