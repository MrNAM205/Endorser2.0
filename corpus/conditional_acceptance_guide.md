# Conditional Acceptance: A Guide to Understanding and Application

This document outlines the principles and application of "Conditional Acceptance" as understood by its proponents, particularly within the context of asserting individual sovereignty.

## Core Principle: All Interactions are Offers

Proponents of Conditional Acceptance view most demands, bills, summons, or notices from government entities or corporations not as absolute obligations, but as "offers" to a contract. The underlying belief is that one is only bound by contracts to which they have knowingly and willingly consented.

## The Mechanism of Conditional Acceptance

Instead of outright denying a demand, which is seen as creating a dispute, Conditional Acceptance involves "accepting" the offer, but only on specific, clearly stated conditions. This transforms the original offer into a counter-offer.

### Key Steps:
1.  **Identify the Offer:** Recognize the demand (e.g., a bill, a traffic ticket, a court summons) as an offer.
2.  **Formulate Conditions:** Clearly state the conditions under which you will accept the offer. These conditions typically involve demanding proof of claim, specific legal authority, or verification of facts.
3.  **Present the Counter-Offer:** Communicate your Conditional Acceptance in writing to the demanding party.
4.  **The Principle of "Silence is Acquiescence":** A central tenet is that if the demanding party fails to meet your conditions or does not respond within a specified timeframe, their silence or failure to perform is interpreted as their agreement to your conditions. This, in the proponent's view, nullifies the original demand or shifts the liability.

## Purpose and Goal

The primary goal of Conditional Acceptance is to:
*   **Shift the Burden of Proof:** Force the demanding party to provide evidence or justification for their claim.
*   **Avoid Unwitting Consent:** Prevent one from unknowingly consenting to a contract or jurisdiction they do not wish to be under.
*   **Assert Sovereignty:** Reclaim perceived individual rights and autonomy by controlling the terms of engagement.

## Example Conditions:
*   "I accept your claim on condition that you provide me with the original wet-ink signature contract."
*   "I accept your demand on condition that you provide proof of your lawful authority and jurisdiction over my sovereign person."
*   "I accept your offer on condition that you provide a full accounting of the debt, including the chain of title."
