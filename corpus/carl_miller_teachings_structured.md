# Carl Miller: Core Teachings and Arguments

This document summarizes the key legal and philosophical teachings of Carl Miller, extracted from his speeches and presentations.

## I. Core Constitutional Philosophy
- The U.S. Constitution as an "Ironclad Contract": Enforceable in a court of law, with citizens as beneficiaries.
- Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Paragraph 2): The Constitution is the supreme law of the land; any conflicting law is null and void from its inception.
- Importance of Knowing Your Rights: "If you don't know your rights, you don't have any rights."
- Timely Assertion of Rights: The concept of "laches" (loss of right due to failure to timely assert).

## II. Key Constitutional Amendments and Interpretations
- **Second Amendment:** Individual right to keep and bear arms; "shall not be infringed" means no infringement is acceptable.
- **Fourth Amendment:** Protection against unreasonable searches and seizures; requirement for probable cause and warrant.
- **Fifth Amendment:** Due Process, self-incrimination, private property for public use.
- **Ninth Amendment:** Enumeration of rights does not deny others retained by the people; Congress cannot add laws that take away existing rights.
- **Tenth Amendment:** Powers not delegated are reserved to states or people; limits police powers to constitutional boundaries.

## III. Key Legal Cases and Their Significance (as interpreted by Carl Miller)
- **Marbury v. Madison (5 U.S. 137):** Establishes that any law in conflict with the Constitution is null and void.
- **Murdoch v. Pennsylvania (319 U.S. 105):** No state may convert a secured liberty into a privilege and issue a license/fee for it.
- **Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham (373 U.S. 262):** If a state converts a right into a privilege and issues a license/fee for it, you can ignore the license and engage in the right with impunity.
- **United States v. Bishop (412 U.S. 346):** Defines "willfulness" as an evil motive or intent to avoid a known duty; provides a defense if one relies on constitutional rights.
- **Owen v. City of Independence (445 U.S. 622) & Maine v. Thibodeau (445 U.S. 914):** Government officials have no immunity when violating constitutional rights.
- **Boyd v. United States (116 U.S. 616):** Protects against encroachment of constitutionally secured liberties; compulsory production of papers is self-incrimination.
- **Miranda v. Arizona (384 U.S. 436):** Importance of remaining silent and demanding an attorney.
- **Norton v. Shelby County (118 U.S. 425):** An unconstitutional act is not law; it confers no rights, imposes no duties, creates no office.
- **Shapiro v. Thompson (394 U.S. 618):** Freedom to travel is a fundamental right.
- **Erie Railroad v. Tompkins (304 U.S. 64):** Establishes duality of citizenship (common law vs. national/admiralty jurisdiction); no federal general common law.
- **McCulloch v. Maryland (17 U.S. 316):** (Cited as previous law, replaced by Erie)
- **Montgomery Wards v. Eugene Glacier (82-002087):** The "coffee beans" case; challenges the substance of money of account.

## IV. Practical Advice and Tactics
- **"Don't talk to them":** Remain silent with law enforcement.
- **"Know your book":** Read and understand the Constitution and Black's Law Dictionary.
- **"UD 1-207 Without Prejudice":** Endorsing documents to reserve rights and avoid admiralty jurisdiction.
- **Challenging Jurisdiction:** Asking if it's a "court of law or equity," demanding proof of jurisdiction.
- **Quo Warranto:** Using this writ to challenge the authority of officials or corporations.
- **Traffic Stops:** Keep hands visible, be courteous, don't admit guilt, challenge the ticket in court using constitutional arguments.
- **Judicial Accountability:** Judges are sworn to uphold the Constitution; they have no immunity for violating rights.
- **"Coffee Beans" Argument:** Challenging the definition of "dollars" in court.
- **Tax Arguments:** Citing Article 1, Section 9, Paragraph 4 (no direct tax without apportionment), Title 31 Section 742 (federal obligations exempt from state tax), and Title 26 (IRS code as regulation, not enacted law).

## V. Philosophical Stance
- **Individual Sovereignty:** The individual is the ultimate authority, not the government.
- **Duty to Defend:** Citizens have a duty to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
- **"American Fighting Soldier":** A self-identification as a defender of the constitutional way of government.
- **Critique of Government:** Views many government actions as unlawful encroachments on rights.
- **Importance of Militia:** The militia as a constitutional check on government power.
