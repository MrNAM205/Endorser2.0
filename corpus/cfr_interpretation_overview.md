# CFR Interpretation: Regulations vs. Law (Proponent's View)

This document explains how proponents of certain legal theories interpret and utilize the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), often distinguishing it from what they consider to be true "law."

## Core Interpretation: Rules for Government Employees, Not Sovereign Individuals

Proponents view the CFR as a set of internal rules, regulations, and policies that govern the operations of federal agencies and their employees. They argue that the CFR does not constitute "law" in the same sense as constitutional or common law, and therefore, its provisions do not apply to sovereign individuals unless they explicitly consent or are acting in a capacity (e.g., as a federal employee or a corporate entity) that falls under its jurisdiction.

## Distinction from "Law"

*   **CFR as Corporate Bylaws:** The CFR is often likened to the bylaws of a corporation (the U.S. government, viewed as a corporate entity). Just as corporate bylaws apply only to the employees and operations of that corporation, the CFR is seen as applying only to federal agencies and their personnel.
*   **True Law vs. Regulation:** A distinction is made between "true law" (e.g., the Constitution, common law) and "regulation" (the CFR). Regulations are seen as having a lower legal standing and are only enforceable against those who are subject to the agency's administrative authority.

## Selective Citation and Misinterpretation

Proponents frequently engage in selective citation and misinterpretation of specific CFR sections to support their claims of exemption or to challenge government authority. They may:

*   **Cite Definitions:** Use definitions within the CFR (e.g., the definition of "person" or "taxpayer") to argue that they do not fit the criteria for being subject to certain regulations.
*   **Highlight Procedural Requirements:** Point to specific procedural requirements within the CFR that they believe agencies must follow, arguing that failure to adhere to these procedures invalidates an agency's action.
*   **Argue Lack of Jurisdiction:** Use CFR provisions to assert that an agency or official lacks jurisdiction over them, based on their interpretation of their sovereign status.

## Goal and Intended Effect

*   **Claim Exemption:** To argue that they are exempt from federal laws, taxes, and mandates that are based on CFR regulations.
*   **Challenge Agency Actions:** To challenge the validity of actions taken by federal agencies by asserting that the agency has not followed its own rules (as laid out in the CFR) or that the rules do not apply to them.
*   **Create Loopholes:** To find or create perceived loopholes within the CFR that they believe validate their sovereign status and non-obligation.
