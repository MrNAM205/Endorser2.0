# UCC Filings for Status and Claim: An Overview

This document explains the use of Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) filings by proponents of certain legal theories to declare status, claim assets, or assert superior interests.

## The UCC and Its Interpretation

The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is a body of law governing commercial transactions in the United States. Proponents interpret the UCC as the operational rulebook for the commercial system they believe the government operates under. They assert that by understanding and correctly applying UCC principles, individuals can navigate or even control this system.

## Connection to the "Strawman" Theory

UCC filings are often directly linked to the "strawman" theory. Proponents believe that the "strawman" (the fictional legal entity created at birth) is a commercial entity. By filing a UCC financing statement, an individual aims to:

*   **Declare Secured Party Status:** Assert themselves as the "secured party" or "creditor" over the "strawman" (the debtor).
*   **Claim Assets:** Claim ownership or a superior interest in the "strawman" and any associated accounts or assets (including the alleged secret Treasury account).
*   **Establish Priority:** Establish a public record of their claim, which they believe gives them priority over other creditors or claimants to the "strawman."

## Common Uses of UCC Filings (Proponent's View)

*   **Status Correction:** As part of a broader "Status Correction" process, to publicly declare one's sovereign status and separate from the perceived "statutory citizen" status.
*   **Debt Discharge:** Some believe that a properly filed UCC can create a mechanism for discharging debts, particularly when combined with concepts like "Accepted for Value."
*   **Retaliation/Harassment:** In some instances, fraudulent UCC filings are used against public officials or private entities as a form of "paper terrorism."

## Types of Filings

*   **UCC-1 Financing Statement:** The primary document used to perfect a security interest in collateral. Proponents use this to declare their security interest in the "strawman" and its assets.
*   **UCC-3 Amendment:** Used to amend or terminate a previously filed UCC-1.

*Disclaimer: The following is a specific interpretation of the Uniform Commercial Code and related legal principles. The use of UCC filings for "status correction," claiming a "strawman," or discharging personal debts is not recognized by mainstream legal systems and is considered fraudulent. Such filings have no legal effect in these contexts and can lead to severe legal consequences, including civil penalties and criminal charges.
