# Surety and Bond Theory: Holding Officials Accountable

This document explains the "Surety and Bond Theory" as interpreted by its proponents, particularly within the context of asserting individual sovereignty and holding public officials accountable.

## Core Principle: All Public Officials are Bonded

Proponents of this theory believe that every public official (e.g., judges, police officers, prosecutors, politicians) is required by law to be bonded. These bonds are seen as a form of insurance or guarantee that the official will perform their duties lawfully and in accordance with their oath of office and the Constitution.

## Connection to "Strawman" and Government Bankruptcy

This theory is often linked to the "strawman" theory and the belief that the U.S. government is bankrupt. The bonds are sometimes perceived as being connected to the alleged secret Treasury accounts associated with the "strawman" entity. The idea is that if the government is operating as a corporation, its agents (officials) must be bonded, just like agents in the private sector.

## Mechanism for Claiming Against Bonds

The process typically involves a series of steps to assert a claim against an official's bond:

1.  **Notice of Violation:** Sending a formal notice to the official, detailing how their actions (or inactions) have violated their oath of office, constitutional rights, or other lawful duties.
2.  **Opportunity to Cure:** Providing the official with a specific timeframe to correct the alleged violation.
3.  **Affidavit of Default:** If the official fails to cure the violation, an affidavit of default is created, documenting their failure to respond or act lawfully.
4.  **Notice of Claim Against Bond:** A formal notice is sent to the official and their bonding company, stating the intent to make a claim against the official's surety bond for damages incurred due to their unlawful actions.

## Goal and Perceived Outcome

The primary goals of employing the Surety and Bond Theory are:

*   **Personal Accountability:** To hold individual public officials personally liable for actions perceived to be outside their lawful authority or in violation of rights.
*   **Leverage:** To gain leverage in legal disputes by threatening or initiating claims against an official's bond.
*   **Financial Compensation:** To obtain financial compensation for damages allegedly caused by an official's unlawful conduct.

*Disclaimer: The following is a specific interpretation of surety law and public official bonding. The "Surety and Bond Theory," as applied to personal claims against public officials' bonds for alleged constitutional violations outside of established legal processes, is not recognized by mainstream legal systems. Attempting to use these arguments in legal proceedings or to file claims against bonds without proper legal grounds can lead to disputes, legal challenges, and severe consequences, including civil penalties and criminal charges.
