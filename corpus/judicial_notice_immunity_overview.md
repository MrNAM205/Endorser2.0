# Judicial Notice and Judicial Immunity: Proponent's View

This document explores the interpretation and application of "Judicial Notice" and "Judicial Immunity" by proponents of certain legal theories, particularly in their efforts to challenge judicial authority and assert claims.

## Reinterpretation of "Judicial Notice"

In mainstream law, judicial notice allows a court to accept certain facts as true without formal proof (e.g., universally known facts, laws). Proponents, however, reinterpret this concept to assert that:

*   **Unrebutted Affidavit as Truth:** An affidavit (a sworn statement of facts) that is presented to a court or official, and which remains unchallenged or "unrebutted" by the opposing party, *must* be taken as "truth in law." They believe that if the opposing party fails to formally rebut the affidavit, they have effectively confessed to its truth.
*   **Court's Duty to Acknowledge:** They argue that the court is then obligated to take "judicial notice" of these unrebutted facts, making them legally binding and dispositive of the case.
*   **"All Law is Based in Truth":** This principle is often cited to support the idea that their unrebutted affidavits establish the fundamental "truth" upon which the court must act.

## Reinterpretation of "Judicial Immunity"

In mainstream law, judges generally have immunity from civil liability for actions taken within their judicial capacity. Proponents challenge this immunity, arguing that:

*   **Loss of Immunity for Violations:** Judges lose their immunity when they violate their oath of office, constitutional rights, or act outside their perceived "true" jurisdiction (e.g., operating under admiralty law instead of common law).
*   **Acting "Under Color of Law/Office":** They assert that judges who enforce statutes or procedures that are deemed unconstitutional or outside the court's proper jurisdiction are acting "under color of law" or "under color of office." In this view, such actions make the judge personally liable for damages.
*   **Oath of Office:** The judge's oath to uphold the Constitution is seen as a personal contract, and any perceived violation of this oath is grounds for personal liability.

## Goal and Application

These reinterpretations are used to:

*   **Challenge Jurisdiction:** To assert that the court lacks proper jurisdiction over the individual or the matter.
*   **Establish Facts:** To establish their version of facts as legally binding through unrebutted affidavits.
*   **Hold Judges Accountable:** To threaten or initiate claims against judges personally for perceived misconduct or violations of rights.

*Disclaimer: The following is a specific interpretation of legal principles. The application of "Judicial Notice" to compel acceptance of unrebutted affidavits as truth in law, or the assertion that judges lose immunity for actions taken in their official capacity outside of established legal processes, is not recognized by mainstream legal systems. Such interpretations are considered pseudolegal and can lead to severe legal consequences, including civil penalties, criminal charges, and contempt of court.
