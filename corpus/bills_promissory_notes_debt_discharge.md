# Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes for Debt Discharge (Proponent's View)

This document explains how Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes are interpreted and used by proponents of certain legal theories for the purpose of debt discharge, often linked to the "strawman" theory and secret Treasury accounts.

## The Interpretation of Financial Instruments

Proponents view standard financial instruments, as well as those they create, through a specific lens:

*   **Bills of Exchange:** A written order by one party (the drawer) to another (the drawee) to pay a third party (the payee). Proponents believe they can act as the drawer, instructing the U.S. Treasury (as the drawee, via the "strawman" account) to pay a creditor (the payee).
*   **Promissory Notes:** A written promise by one party (the maker) to pay a specific amount to another (the payee). Proponents believe they can create their own promissory notes, backed by the value in their "strawman" account, to discharge debts.

## Connection to the "Strawman" and Secret Accounts

These instruments are central to the belief that individuals can access a secret "Treasury Direct Account" or "strawman" account. The theory suggests that:

1.  The U.S. government became bankrupt (often linked to HJR-192 in 1933) and pledged its citizens as collateral.
2.  A fictional legal entity (the "strawman") was created for each individual, linked to a secret Treasury account holding significant value.
3.  By properly creating and presenting these instruments, one can instruct the Treasury to discharge debts from these accounts.

## Mechanism for Debt Discharge

Proponents assert that by creating and submitting these documents, they are:

*   **Tendering Payment:** Presenting a valid instrument for payment or discharge of a debt.
*   **Shifting Liability:** If the creditor refuses the tendered instrument, the liability for the debt is shifted, and the "sovereign debtor" is absolved of responsibility.
*   **Utilizing UCC:** Misinterpreting the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) to support the validity and enforceability of these self-created instruments.

## Common Tactics

*   **Fraudulent Documents:** Often involve unusual notations, such as names spelled in all capital letters, fictitious routing numbers, and references to misinterpretations of the UCC.
*   **"Bonding" Debts:** The idea that these instruments act as a form of bond to cover the debt.

The creation and use of self-issued Bills of Exchange or Promissory Notes for personal debt discharge, as described above, are not recognized by mainstream financial institutions or legal systems. Such practices are considered fraudulent and can lead to severe legal consequences, including civil penalties, criminal charges, and the failure to discharge actual debts.
