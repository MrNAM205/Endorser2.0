# Presentment for Acceptance/Dishonor: A Strategy for Debt Discharge

This document explains the concept of "Presentment for Acceptance/Dishonor" as interpreted and used by proponents of certain legal theories for the purpose of debt discharge and asserting claims.

## Core Principle: Dishonor as Acceptance

Proponents believe that when a document (such as a bill, summons, or even a self-created instrument like a Bill of Exchange) is formally "presented" to a party, that party has a duty to "accept" or respond to its terms. If the party fails to do so within a specified timeframe, it constitutes "dishonor."

## Interpretation of Dishonor

In this context, "dishonor" is not merely a failure to pay, but is interpreted as:

*   **Agreement to Terms:** The silence or failure to respond to the terms of the presentment is seen as an agreement to the presenter's claims.
*   **Discharge of Debt:** This perceived agreement, or the act of dishonor itself, is believed to discharge the presenter from the original debt or obligation.
*   **Shifting Liability:** The liability for the original debt is believed to shift to the dishonoring party.

## Connection to the UCC and "Strawman" Theory

This theory heavily relies on a specific interpretation of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), particularly articles related to negotiable instruments and presentment. Proponents often assert that:

*   Bills and other demands are "negotiable instruments" that must be properly presented and accepted.
*   Their self-created instruments (e.g., Sovereign Bills of Exchange) are also valid negotiable instruments.
*   The process is linked to the "strawman" theory, where the presentment is ultimately directed at the U.S. Treasury via the "strawman" account.

## Mechanism and Tactics

*   **Formal Presentment:** Documents are typically sent via Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, to establish proof of delivery.
*   **Notice of Dishonor:** If the presented document is not accepted or responded to, a formal "Notice of Dishonor" is issued, documenting the failure to respond and asserting the consequences (e.g., discharge of debt, confession of judgment).

## Goal and Intended Effect

*   **Debt Discharge:** To discharge personal debts (e.g., mortgages, credit cards, taxes) without actual payment.
*   **Avoid Legal Obligations:** To avoid legal obligations or jurisdiction by asserting that the original demand has been dishonored.
*   **Create Leverage:** To create leverage in disputes by documenting the alleged dishonor.

*Disclaimer: The following is a specific interpretation of commercial law and legal procedures. The application of "Presentment for Acceptance/Dishonor" as described above is not recognized by mainstream legal systems for the purpose of discharging personal debts or avoiding legal obligations. Such practices are considered pseudolegal, have no legal validity, and can lead to severe legal consequences, including civil penalties, criminal charges, and the failure to discharge actual debts.
