# The Rationale Behind "Accepted for Value" (A4V)

This document explains the historical and legal arguments proponents use to support the Accepted for Value doctrine.

## The Foundational Argument: HJR-192

The core of the A4V argument rests on House Joint Resolution 192, passed on June 5, 1933. This resolution suspended the gold standard, meaning that debts could no longer be paid in gold. Proponents interpret this to mean that the government declared bankruptcy and that no true "payment" of debt has been possible since.

Instead of "paying" debts, all debts public and private are now "discharged" using commercial instruments. From this perspective, all bills, fines, and notices are considered offers to discharge a liability.

## The "Strawman" and the UCC

The theory posits that upon a person's birth, the government creates a fictional legal entity, or "strawman," which is used for all commerce. This strawman is linked to a secret account at the U.S. Treasury.

The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is seen as the set of rules governing this commercial system. Bills and notices are viewed not as simple demands for money, but as "negotiable instruments" that can be processed under UCC rules.

## The A4V Process as a Remedy

By writing "Accepted for Value" on a bill, an individual is acting as the beneficiary of their strawman account. The process is understood as:

1.  **Accepting the Offer:** You "accept" the bill (the offer) for its face value.
2.  **Authorizing Discharge:** You endorse the instrument, which authorizes the Treasury to discharge the amount of the bill using the funds from your secret strawman account.

This effectively transforms the bill from a liability into an asset that can be used to settle the account.
