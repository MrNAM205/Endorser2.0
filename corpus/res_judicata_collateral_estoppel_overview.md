# Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel: Reinterpreted Legal Principles

This document explores the reinterpretation and application of "Res Judicata" and "Collateral Estoppel" by proponents of certain legal theories, particularly in their efforts to prevent re-litigation or challenge previous judgments.

## Reinterpretation of "Res Judicata" (Claim Preclusion)

In mainstream law, Res Judicata prevents the re-litigation of an entire claim or cause of action once a final judgment on the merits has been rendered. Proponents, however, reinterpret this to assert that:

*   **Self-Created Judgments:** A prior ruling (even one that rejected their claims of sovereignty or jurisdiction) or a "judgment" from a self-created "common law court" should preclude future legal actions against them.
*   **Unrebutted Affidavits:** An "unrebutted affidavit" (a sworn statement of facts that remains unchallenged by the opposing party) constitutes a final judgment on the merits, and thus the matter is "res judicata."

## Reinterpretation of "Collateral Estoppel" (Issue Preclusion)

In mainstream law, Collateral Estoppel prevents the re-litigation of specific issues of fact or law that have been actually litigated and decided in a prior proceeding. Proponents reinterpret this to assert that:

*   **Issues "Decided" by Default:** An issue (e.g., their sovereign status, the illegitimacy of a statute) has been "decided" in their favor through an "unrebutted affidavit" or a "confession of judgment" in a private administrative process. Therefore, this issue cannot be re-litigated in any subsequent proceeding.
*   **Binding Effect of Private Process:** They believe the findings of their private administrative processes have the same binding effect as a court judgment, and thus create a basis for collateral estoppel.

## Goal and Application

These reinterpretations are used to:

*   **Prevent Further Legal Action:** To argue that a matter has been settled and cannot be pursued further by the opposing party.
*   **Establish "Truth" of Claims:** To establish the "truth" of their claims through their own processes, which they believe then binds the courts.
*   **Overwhelm the System:** To present complex, pseudolegal arguments that can confuse and frustrate the judicial system.

*Disclaimer: The following is a specific interpretation of legal principles. The application of "Res Judicata" and "Collateral Estoppel" as described above, particularly when based on self-created judgments or unrebutted affidavits outside of established legal processes, is not recognized by mainstream legal systems. Such interpretations are considered pseudolegal and can lead to severe legal consequences, including civil penalties, criminal charges, and contempt of court.
