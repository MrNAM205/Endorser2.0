# Common Law vs. Admiralty/Maritime Law: A Jurisdictional Distinction

This document explores the distinction between Common Law and Admiralty/Maritime Law as interpreted by proponents of certain legal theories, particularly within the context of individual sovereignty.

## The Core Distinction (Proponent's View)

Proponents argue that there are two fundamental legal systems operating in parallel:

1.  **Common Law:** This is viewed as the law of the land, based on natural rights, historical precedent, and the consent of the governed. It is often associated with individual liberty, property rights, and a jury of one's peers.
2.  **Admiralty/Maritime Law:** This is viewed as the law of the sea, governing commerce, contracts, and international trade. Proponents argue that this commercial law has been unlawfully extended to govern land-based interactions, thereby subjecting individuals to a system of corporate control rather than natural rights.

## The Perceived "Shift" in Jurisdiction

Many proponents believe that a fundamental shift occurred in U.S. legal history, moving the nation from a common law foundation to one primarily governed by admiralty/maritime law. This shift is often attributed to events such as:

*   **The U.S. abandonment of the gold standard in 1933 (HJR-192):** Interpreted as a declaration of national bankruptcy, leading to a commercial system where citizens are treated as collateral.
*   **The Civil War:** Seen by some as a turning point where federal power expanded and common law principles were eroded.

## Admiralty Law and the "Strawman"

Under this interpretation, admiralty law is linked to the "strawman" concept. The argument is that when a birth certificate is issued, it creates a corporate entity (the "strawman") that operates under admiralty/commercial law. Individuals are then unknowingly treated as this corporate entity, subject to statutory laws, taxes, and regulations that would not apply to a "flesh-and-blood" common law person.

## Perceived Methods for Operating Under Common Law

Proponents advocate various strategies to "opt out" of perceived admiralty jurisdiction and operate under common law, including:

*   **Status Correction:** Declaring oneself a "common law free man" or "state national."
*   **Conditional Acceptance:** Using specific contractual language to challenge demands and assert common law rights.
*   **UCC Filings:** Utilizing Uniform Commercial Code filings to declare one's status or claim assets.
*   **Avoiding Consent:** Being careful not to unknowingly consent to contracts or jurisdiction (e.g., by signing documents without reservation).
