# Status Correction: Reclaiming Your Sovereign Standing

This document explains the concept of "Status Correction" as understood by its proponents, particularly in relation to the 14th Amendment and the idea of a "statutory citizen."

## The 14th Amendment and "Statutory Citizenship"

Proponents of Status Correction interpret the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as having created two distinct classes of citizens:

1.  **Constitutional Citizen:** This refers to the original understanding of citizenship, where individuals possess inherent natural rights and operate under common law.
2.  **Statutory Citizen (or "14th Amendment Citizen"):** This is seen as a citizen created by statute, subject to legislative control. Proponents argue that by accepting government-issued identifiers (like Social Security Numbers, driver's licenses, birth certificates), individuals unknowingly consent to this "statutory" status, which is viewed as a corporate or federal citizenship.

## The Purpose of Status Correction

Status Correction is the process by which individuals aim to "reclaim their estate" and assert their status as a "constitutional citizen" or "common law free man." The goal is to:

*   **Reclaim Natural Rights:** Assert rights believed to be inherent and not granted by the state.
*   **Escape Perceived Control:** Operate outside the jurisdiction of what is viewed as a "corporate" or illegitimate government.
*   **Change Legal Standing:** Shift from a perceived "debtor" or "subject" status to a "creditor" or "sovereign" status.

## Common Mechanisms and Documents

The process often involves a series of steps and the filing of specific documents:

*   **Understanding Legal Definitions:** A deep study of legal terms and their perceived true meanings.
*   **Authenticating Birth Certificates:** Viewing the birth certificate as a bond or trust instrument that created the "strawman" entity.
*   **Affidavits of Fact/Status:** Sworn statements declaring one's chosen status (e.g., common law free man, state national).
*   **UCC Filings:** Using Uniform Commercial Code financing statements to declare one's status or claim a superior interest in the "strawman" entity.
*   **Renunciation of Citizenship (Specific Forms):** Some interpretations involve specific forms of renunciation of federal citizenship, while claiming state nationality.
*   **Changing Domicile:** Asserting a domicile under common law jurisdiction rather than statutory jurisdiction.
