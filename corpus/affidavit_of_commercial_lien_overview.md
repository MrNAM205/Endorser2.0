# Affidavit of Commercial Lien: Asserting a Claim

This document explains the "Affidavit of Commercial Lien" as interpreted and used by proponents of certain legal theories to assert a claim against an individual or entity.

## Core Principle: Creating a Public Record of Debt

Proponents use an Affidavit of Commercial Lien to declare that a specific individual or entity (often a public official or corporation) owes them a sum of money. This is typically based on perceived violations of rights, breaches of contract, or unlawful actions that have caused damages.

## Connection to Private Administrative Process (PAP)

Commercial liens often follow a "Private Administrative Process" (PAP). If a party fails to respond to a series of notices (e.g., Notice of Fault, Affidavit of Default), proponents interpret this silence or failure to cure as a "confession of judgment" or an agreement to the terms set forth in the notices. The commercial lien is then filed to create a public record of this alleged debt.

## Connection to the "Strawman" Theory

The lien is frequently linked to the "strawman" theory. Proponents may assert that the lien is filed against the "strawman" entity of the alleged debtor, or that the damages are owed to the "living man/woman" by the "strawman" of the official.

## Mechanism and Filing

*   **Affidavit:** The document is a sworn statement of facts, detailing the alleged violations and the damages incurred.
*   **Filing:** The affidavit is then filed in public records, typically with county clerks or secretaries of state. Proponents believe this act of public filing creates a valid, enforceable lien against the alleged debtor's property or assets.

## Goal and Intended Effect

*   **Public Record:** To create a public record of the alleged debt and the official's perceived default.
*   **Harassment/Intimidation:** To exert pressure on the alleged debtor, particularly public officials, and to disrupt their financial affairs or credit.
*   **Claiming Damages:** To assert a claim for financial compensation for perceived damages.

"Affidavits of Commercial Lien," as used for personal claims against individuals or public officials outside of established legal judgments or recognized commercial transactions, are not recognized by mainstream legal systems. Such documents are considered fraudulent, have no legal validity, and can lead to severe legal consequences, including civil penalties, criminal charges, and the inability to conduct financial transactions.
